	<h1>Potential future features of the Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		A wide range of institutions and people have suggested features for
		OED. The following list of such requests is unordered. We don't know
		when we will implement them and input from users does impact what we
		do sooner rather than later. If you want to make a suggestion or support a request then you can see how on the
		<a href="suggestions.html">suggestion page</a>.
	Our <a href="plans.html">plans</a> for the near future are also available.</p>
	<p>The requested features list is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Radar/clock type visualization of data.</li>
		<li>Map representation of data with possible layers for different
			types of information.</li>
		<li>Acquire meter data from more types of meters including
			BACnet, Modbus, BAS systems.</li>
		<li>Show energy cost for usage.</li>
		<li>Logins for people other than admins such as student, visitor,
			facilities.</li>
		<li>Other graphical representations such as heat maps, low/high,
			comparison to typical usage, inclusion of temperature on line graphs,
			comparison to targets.</li>
		<li>Building descriptions with usage by building.</li>
		<li>Normalize graphs for # people, size (sq. feet, cubic feet),
			weather (degree heat/cool days, sunny/cloudy, wind).</li>
		<li>Allow arbitrary arithmetic on meter or combinations of meters
			data to correct for issues, scale readings, and treat generated energy (such as
			solar) as negative.</li>
		<li>Create PDF poster for competitions from template but
			customizable.</li>
		<li>Multi-institution comparison & competition.</li>
		<li>Create data for standard reports including ENERGY STAR, GRITS.</li>
		<li>Social media to ask questions, report issues in
			sustainability, question of the day.</li>
		<li>Track projects with expected and actual savings.</li>
		<li>Display peak loads and also warn if approaching a peak so can
			avoid going higher.</li>
		<li>Notifications (email, text) to admins when approaching peak,
			unusual readings that might indicate a problem, exceeding threshold.</li>
		<li>Fit data to curves.</li>
		<li>Track people in buildings over time to see if interventions
			spread and stay over time.</li>
		<li>Psychology for change such as cute images, energy tips.</li>
	</ul>
