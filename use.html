	<h1>Using Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		The OED project will be forever free and anyone is welcome to use it.
		Since the system is under active development, we strongly encourage
		you to <a href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact
			us</a> to use the system. The possible ways to use the OED system are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Get your site set up on our server at no charge. You will
			have your own URL to access your data from a web browser. The
			advantage is we can easily update the system - something desirable
			during this rapid development stage. Simply <a
			href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact us</a> to
			arrange this.
		</li>
		<li>Install the system at your own site. At this time it is best
			to <a href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact
				us</a> for help in doing this. This is a good option if you want to keep
			your data isolated to your own systems. Note that OED allows you to
			export the meter data in our system at any time so even if we host
			your site then you still have complete access to the data.
		</li>
		<li>Download and install the software yourself. We are an open
			source project so you can get the software at any time. You can also
			modify the software for your own uses but must live by the terms of
			<a href="license.html">our license</a> that generally requires you to share what you develop for
			the good of everyone. Except for those working on the team of
			developers, we encourage you to consider one of the two options above
			at this time.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note you can install OED via Docker which helps automate this process. We are happy
	to help with initial setup of this process at your site.</p>
