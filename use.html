	<h1>Using Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		The OED project will be forever free and anyone is welcome to use it.
		Since the system is under active development, we strongly encourage
		you to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
			us</a> to use the system. The possible ways to use the OED system are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install the system at your own site. At this time it is best
			to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
				us</a> for help in doing this. This is a good option if you want to keep
			your data isolated to your own systems.
		<li>For testing and special reasons, you might be able to temporarily host a site on our server. Please <a
				href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
				us</a> about this.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Download and install the software yourself. We are an open
			source project so you can get the software at any time. You can also
			modify the software for your own uses but must live by the terms of
			<a href="license.html">our license</a> that generally requires you to share what you develop for
			the good of everyone. Except for those working on the team of
			developers, we encourage you to consider one of the two options above
			at this time.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note you can install OED via Docker which helps automate this process. We are happy
		to help with initial setup of this process at your site.</p>
