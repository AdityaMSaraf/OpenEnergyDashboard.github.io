	<h1>Using Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		The OED project will be forever free and anyone is welcome to use it.
		Since the system is under active development, we strongly encourage
		you to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
			us</a> to use the system. The possible ways to use the OED system are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install the system at your own site. OED is installed with the Docker container system. Feel free
			to <a href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
				us</a> for help in doing this. This is a good option if you want to keep
			your data isolated to your own systems.</li>
		<li>For testing and special reasons, you might be able to temporarily host a site on our server. Please <a
				href="mailto:info@OpenEnergyDashboard.org">contact
				us</a> about this.</li>
	</ul>
