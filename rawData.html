	<h3>OED feature enhancement: providing raw data to user</h3>
	<h4>Idea</h4>
	<p>Users should be able to get the raw data from our collection of
		meter data and also get any aggregation of that data. The spring 2019
		release of OED will use the Plotly graphics package that allows us to
		include zooming and scrolling of graphs. The idea is a user will use
		these graphics features to specify the date range they desire in the
		downloaded data where a special case is zooming out to all time to get
		a full dump of all values. An advantage of doing this is the user can
		visually see what they will get before downloading and this should
		lead to fewer downloads that are not what was desired. OED already has
		a feature that allow the user to look at a graph and download the data
		points represented but those are averages of the actual meter readings
		to reduce the data sent. This will be modified to provide all the raw
		data in the CSV file.
	<p>An important consideration is the quantity of data downloaded.
		With the current feature there are, by definition, only a limited
		number of points since a graphical display cannot show more than about
		1000 points per line. However, the raw data can contain a large number
		of points. It may be a larger quantity at any given time if multiple
		users request download around the same time (as classes sometimes do).
		To deal with this the user will be notified of the size of the
		download and asked to verify before it begins. OED will also rate
		limit the number of downloads at any given time so it does not unduly
		impact server performance.
	<h4>Implementation</h4>
	The database query to get the raw data is a small change from getting
	the averaged data displayed on the graph so this change should be easy.
	The user interface needs to be modified to allow for the raw data
	download and the confirmation message. A new database query needs to be
	created to count the number of points that will be generated by the raw
	data to estimate the size of data involved. The part that will be
	harder is to create a system that will rate limit the number of
	requests from all users on an OED instance on a server. This should be
	designed so the user can do other work while waiting for the download
	to complete. A simple way would be to queue the requests and do them in
	order received but a more sophisticated way would be better. It would
	also be nice if the user was aware of the status and progress of any
	download request.
	<p>It would also be interesting to consider if we should download
		non-line data from OED graphics such as bar charts, pie charts and
		radar graphs. The design of how to put these into a CSV would need to
		be done first.
	<h4>Difficulty</h4>
	<p>
		This should be a fairly easy project. It is possible to combine this
		project with the <a href="admin.html">admin panel project</a> (since
		they have some relationship) for a student with sufficient knowledge
		and drive.
