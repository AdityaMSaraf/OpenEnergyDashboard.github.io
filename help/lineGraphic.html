	<h1>OED Line Graphic (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>A line graphic shows each meter and group as a unique line showing usage across time. The following figure shows
		a line graphic of two meters (??names) and two groups (??names). To get this graphic, you click the "Line"
		choice
		(highlighted with a blue box).</p>
	<img alt="sample line graphic for two meters and two groups" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>A line graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can control
		the time frame (dates shown) on the line graphic.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>You select the <a href="graphingMeters.html">meters</a> and/or <a href="graphingGroups.html">groups</a> to graph
		in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as an individual line as shown in the figure above. The
		time frame (days) shown on the x-axis will be the maximum time for all all meters and groups. If different
		meters and group have data for different time ranges then some lines will not span the entire length of the
		x-axis. The next figure shows this where the meters ?? do not span the full range of time on the graph. (Note we
		will often use meters in these sample figures
		but the same ideas apply equally to graphs.)</p>
	<img alt="sample line graphic where the meters data is different time frames" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>This graphic also demonstrates another potential issue. If the values of one or more meters are substantially
		less than another meter then the values for these meters will be very close to the x-axis. You can see these
		values by removing the values for the meters or groups with larger values. One way to do this is to remove a
		meter from graphing by clicking the "X" next to its name in the list (details on the <a
			href="graphingMeters.html">meters</a>/<a href="graphingGroups.html">groups</a> viewing help
		pages). This works but is slower since OED must recalculate the values via the server (see <a
			href="#details">details</a> below). It also means you won't see these meters/groups in other graphics since
		they were removed. A nice solution is to click on the name of the meter/group at the top of the line graphic. In
		the next figure, the ?? meter names were clicked (highlighted with blue boxes) and the graph quickly redrew to
		what is shown with the y-axis scale re-calibrated for the remaining meters. The meters not being show are in
		shadow font?? and have a line through the name.</p>
	<img alt="removing meters from a line graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>You can click on a meter/group with a line through it to get it to quickly reappear on the line graphic.</p>

	<h3 id="scrollZoom">Scrolling and zooming</h3>
	<p>Initially, OED shows the line graphic across all time that is available. Sometimes you want to look at a smaller
		time range. You can achieve this by zooming in the time (x) axis. This is done by clicking and dragging the
		black rectangles below the x-axis (highlighted with blue boxes in the figure below). As you slide the
		black rectangle, the parts of the x-axis (time) that is removed from the graph is show by a gray filled
		rectangle (highlighted in light blue box). The white area between the gray rectangles is the time being shown.
		In
		the figure below the original time from of ?? was reduced to ??.</p>
	<img alt="reducing time shown in a line graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>Once you are zoomed in so gray areas are shown for the removed time, you can click within these areas to modify
		the time range shown but the behavior is a little more complex and likely to take time to learn to use.</p>
	<p>If only part of the time is shown, then you can scroll to see the other times. The total time displayed remains
		the same but the times included change as you scroll. You do this by clicking and dragging in the white area
		below the x-axis
		that shows the time being displayed (highlighted with blue box in the next figure). The next figure shows the
		process
		of dragging where the time displayed has now changed to ??.</p>
	<img alt="scrolling time in a line graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">

	<p>If you zoom in significantly so the time range is much smaller than the original time range, the graph can become
		jagged due to having too few points. Also, you might want to return the graphic to its original, full time
		range. Both of these are discussed in the next section on the "Redraw" and "Restore" buttons.
	</p>

	<p>The next figure shows the result of zooming in even farther so a limited time range is shown:</p>
	<img alt="zooming to a limited time range on a line graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>As you can see, the lines have become jagged. This happens due to the limited number of points available. (see <a
			href="#redrawDetails">below</a> for the details of why). If you want to see this time range with more
		points then click the "Redraw" button (highlighted with a blue box) below the graph. The figure below shows the
		result of
		doing this.</p>
	<img alt="result of redrawing a line graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>Note that once you do this, the time range is reset so you cannot zoom outward nor scroll to times outside the
		new range. If you want to see other time ranges, you can click the "Restore" button (highlighted with a blue
		box) and the graph will return to its original view with the time range including all meters. The result of
		doing this is shown in the next figure.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

	<h3>Exporting graph data</h3>
	<p>You can export the data represented on a line graphic. You can use the line graph to get the time range and
		meters/groups you want. See the <a href="export.html">export help page</a> for further information.</p>

	<h3>Plotly graph controls</h3>
	<p>As shown in the next figure, the Plotly (the underlying graphic package) graphical
		controls (highlighted by a blue box) are available for usage. The most useful might be the camera that allows
		you to download a PNG for the graph. Note that using some of the other controls (zoom, pan, etc.) may cause
		unexpected behavior as OED is also using those features.</p>

	<h3 id="colors">Colors of lines</h3>
	<p>The color of lines is always the same for a given meter or group. This means everyone sees the same color
		for a
		given meter or group whenever it is graphed. The line colors are chosen to try to provide contrast
		between
		different lines. They are also designed to
		give some differentiation between meters and groups when possible. OED tries to show meters in lighter colors
		and
		groups in darker colors. This is not guaranteed as colors are reused between groups and meters if the number
		in
		either category becomes large. OED also tries to give a unique color to each line but that may not
		happen when
		the number of meters and groups is large. Note both of these depend on the number of meters and groups
		at the
		OED site and not the number being shown. Finally, a given meter or group will have the same color on the
		line,
		bar and map graphic.</p>

	<h3 id="redrawDetails">Why do I need to Redraw and Restore?</h3>
	<p>OED is designed to be fast on any reasonable device. When you are zooming and scrolling within a line
		graphic,
		the work is all done in your web browser so it will have a very fast response rate. If OED recalculated
		the
		points shown as you zoomed/scrolled then it would be substantially slower, esp. if it needed to access
		the
		site's server to get new
		data. OED could try to determine when you are done zooming/scrolling and then recalculate the points but
		it is
		very difficult to determine when that has happened given users often pause during these operations.
		Thus, to be
		fast and allow you to get high quality line graphs, OED needs you to let it know when you are done and
		need the
		points displayed to be reset. The "Redraw" button is how you do that. You can also tell OED when you want
		to go
		back to the original graphic via the "Restore" button. This allows you to see all the data and/or
		zoom/scroll to
		other areas of the graph.</p>

	<h3 id="averaging">Why doesn't OED show all the meter/group data?</h3>
	<p>Meters often get a new data point every 15 to 60 minutes and groups inherit that value. This means
		a given
		meter or group can have a lot of data points. For example, a meter reading every 20 minutes for a year
		has over
		26,000 data points. OED refers to these points as the original or raw meter data. There would be two
		main issues
		in showing you all the raw data. First, it would be
		significantly slower. All that data needs to be located in the OED database and then transferred across
		the
		network to your device. If you are on a mobile device you may be paying to transfer the data. Second,
		you would
		not be able to see all the points even if OED tried to graph them. Screen resolutions are in the
		hundreds to
		thousands of pixels (a single point on the screen) and the line graphics only get a subset of those
		pixels. That
		means OED cannot show more than hundreds to a few thousand points (if you have an HD screen). A massive
		number
		of points would be lost in viewing. Thus, OED averages the data on the site server to reduce the number
		of
		points it sends to your web browser for graphing. Thus, a point is the average energy usage across that time.
		Typically it averages across a day of data to be
		highly
		responsive. If you have limited data points for day averages then it will use smaller time intervals
		between
		points and will go to the original meter data when the number is small enough. This is still fast since
		the
		number of points to get is small and the number transmitted is also small. OED will average together
		multiple
		days if you have too many days to represent (if you are showing multiple years of data). These details
		are
		generally not important to you except to know that you are often looking at averaged data. Zooming in to
		a
		smaller time frame and redrawing or downloading the raw meter data for a graph are ways to see the
		original
		meter data.</p>
