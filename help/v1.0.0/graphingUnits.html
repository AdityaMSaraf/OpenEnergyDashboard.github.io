	<h1>Graphing Unit (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	A graphic unit is the units that the user can choose for graphing meter/group data. The unit menu on each graphic
	page shows all the allowed (compatible) units that are available so the user can see the current graphic unit and
	select any available graphic unit. Since you can only graph one unit at a time, any new graphic unit replaces the
	current one. General information on units and the ones in the example used on these pages is <a
		href="./exampleDescription.html#units">available</a>.

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>The unit menu on each graphic page is shown in the following figure (highlighted in blue box):</p>
	<img alt="Graphic unit menu" src="./images/graphicUnitMenuInitial.png">
	<p>As shown, when you first load OED there is no graphic unit so it has "Select Unit". If the user selects a meter
		or group, then the default graphic unit associated with that meter or group will become the current unit. In the
		following figure, "Dining Hall Electric" was selected so OED automatically sets the units to "kWh". (Both shown
		in blue rectangle.) The y-axis
		graphing unit on this line graphic is the related unit of kW. See TODO for information on the unit used in the
		graphic.</p>
	<img alt="Graphic after selecting the Dining Hall Electric meter" src="./images/graphicUnitMenuAfterMeter.png">
	<p>Clicking on the down arrow to reveal the "Units:"" options will show all units and their status for the selected
		meter(s)/group(s) as show in this figure for the allowed units (they all just happen to fit in the dropdown
		display size):</p>
	<img alt="Graphic unit menu showing allowed choices" src="./images/graphicUnitMenuAllowedChoices.png">
	<p>For the selected meter of "Dining Hall Electric", there are seven allowed units starting with "BTU" and ending
		with
		"US $" plus the already selected one of "kWh". Note the order of units is alphabetical withing each category.
		These are the seven units that are
		compatible in which you can graph the selected meters/groups. If you scroll down in the dropdown menu,
		you will see the incompatible (or not allowed) units. These are the units that cannot be used for graphing these
		meters/groups even though they are available at this site. There is a separated labeled "-----Incompatible
		Units-----" and these units are shown grayed out so they cannot be selected. With the selected meter, their are
		nine incompatible units starting with Celsius and going to ton. In the following figure you can only see the
		first six through lb. The remaining ones could be seen by scrolling the dropdown choices.</p>
	<img alt="Graphic unit menu showing incompatible choices" src="./images/graphicUnitMenuIncomptibleChoices.png">
	<p>Any allowed unit can be selected to update the displayed graphic unit. As shown in the following figure, "US $"
		was selected and the y-axis label became "US $/hour". See TODO for information on the time unit
		used and how to change it.</p>
	<img alt="Graphic after selecting US $ unit" src="./images/graphicAfterUSDollar.png">
	<p>Selecting additional meters/groups will not change the graphic unit on the "Units" menu but it can alter the
		allowed/incompatible units that are displayed. This is due to the fact that the allowed units are those that are
		allowed for all meters and groups selected. See TODO for more information.</p>
	<p>At times you may want to clear all selected meters and groups to restart anew. If you click the "x" next to the
		selected unit, as shown in the following figure, it will do this. The place to click is red as is automatically
		done when you hover over the "x". It will also clear the unit and reset it back
		to "Select Unit". Overall, this will put it back to the initial page when OED was loaded as shown at the top of
		this page.</p>
	<img alt="Clearing graphic unit" src="./images/graphicUnitClearing.png">
	<p>While less common, one can select a unit before any meter/group when it has "Select Unit". When this is done, the
		y-axis label is updated but nothing is graphed. In the following figure, the "Units" was set to "BTU" (shown in
		blue rectangle) and the y-axis label became "BTU/Hour":</p>
	<img alt="Selecting graphic unit before meter/group" src="./images/graphicUnitInitialSet.png">

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>An easy way to see all available graphing units is to use the "Units" dropdown menu when no meter/group is
		selected. Since all units are allowed, they will all be seen. You can also see at any time but once a
		meter/group is selected it is likely they are separated by allowed/incompatible.</p>
	<p>The "Units" menu allows for incremental search as usual in OED menus. Typing character will limit the options.
		Note if you do this and don't select an option, OED will set the unit to "Select Unit" and clear all your
		selected meters/groups. To avoid this, delete the character(s) entered for the search to get back to just the
		previously selected unit.</p>
