	<h1>Admin Conversion Creating (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user. </p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin conversion creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to creating a new
		conversion on an OED site. It is accessed from
		the <a href="./adminConversionViewing.html">admin conversion viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
		Conversion" button near the top of that page. Further <a href="./conversionsUnits.html">information on
			conversions</a> is available and this page assumes you understand about conversions.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Admin conversion creating popup" src="./images/adminConversionCreatingPopup.png"></p>
	<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Source. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the source unit of the conversion. The result of
			clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.</li>
		<p><img alt="Admin conversion source input" src="./images/adminConversionSource.png"></p>
		<p>All the available units will be shown and any one can be selected by clicking it. Note that units that are
			not displayable to all users are also included. This field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected
			as
			is shown in the figures. If you change the source unit after selecting the destination unit then the
			type and existing errors can occur as described for the destination unit.</p>
		<li>Destination. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the destination unit of the conversion. The menu
			is the same as the one for the source dropdown. All the available units will be shown and any one can be
			selected by clicking it. Note that units that
			are
			not displayable to all users are also included. This field will be outlined in red until a unit is
			selected
			as
			is shown in the figures. Note the destination unit cannot be a meter unit and if you
			select one of these an error pop up will occur as in the following figure:</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin conversion meter destination error" src="./images/adminConversionDestinationMeterError.png"
			style="width:448">
		<p>After clicking "OK" the selected meter unit will be used and must be changed before the conversion can be
			saved. Also, the destination unit cannot be of a different unit type and if you
			select one of these an error pop up will occur as in the following figure:</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin conversion unit type destination error" src="./images/adminConversionDestinationTypeError.png"
			style="width:443">
		</p>
		<p>After clicking "OK" the selected meter unit will be used and must be changed before the conversion can be
			saved. Finally, the destination unit cannot create a conversion that already exists and if you
			select one that causes this an error pop up will occur as in the following figure:</li>
		</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin conversion unit existing destination error"
			src="./images/adminConversionDestinationExistingError.png" style="width:447">
		<p>After clicking "OK" the selected meter unit will be used and must be changed before the conversion can be
			saved.</p>
		<p>Even though OED excludes certain types of conversions, great care should be taken in creating a new
			conversion as they can cause undesirable behavior at the site. For example, one can create a conversion
			between kWh and kg because they are both quantity units. However, it probably does not make sense to convert
			electrical usage into mass. Thus, only desired and correct conversions should be added into OED. (Note one
			might create a conversion between kWh and CO<sub>2</sub> which is a type of mass unit but is different and
			not a general mass unit. This is done by using a <a href="./conversionsUnits.html#suffix">suffix unit</a>.)
		</p>
		<li>Bidirectional. This dropdown menu can be "yes" (default) or "no". "yes" indicates the conversion is
			bidirectional and goes in both directions and "no"
			indicates the
			conversion is unidirectional and only goes from the source to destination. OED will automatically invert
			a bidirectional conversion to the other direction with the correct values.</li>
		<li>Slope. This inputs the slope of the conversion from the source to destination. Default is zero and that is
			generally not desired so it should be changed. The last digit cannot
			be deleted from this input field when typing in a number so care should be taken in entering values. Note
			that
			you can select the entire field and then enter new values by typing.</li>
		<li>Intercept. This inputs the intercept of the conversion from the source to destination. Input is similar to
			slope. Default is zero and that is often the desired value.</li>
		<li>Note. This allows input of additional information about the conversion that one wants to store.</li>
