	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin unit creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to create a new
		unit on an OED site. It is accessed from
		the <a href="./adminUnitViewing.html">admin unit viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
		Unit" button near the top of that page. Further <a href="./conersionsUnits.html">information on
			units</a> is available and this page assumes one understands about units.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Admin unit creating popup" src="./images/adminUnitCreatingPopup.png"></p>
	<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identifier. This is the "name" of the unit shown when <a href="graphingMeters.html">graphing meters</a>. The
			identifier of a unit must be different from any other unit. If no identifier is
			provided then the name provided is automatically used.</li>
		<li>Name. This is the name of the unit. It is often the same as the identifier but can differ. The name is
			whatever the site wants to use internally for the unit and is not displayed to non-admin
			users. This field will be outlined in red until a name is input as
			is shown in the figure above.</li>
		<li>Type of Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the unit's type. The default choice is "unit".
			More details are given
			on the <a href="./conversionsUnits.html">information on units</a> page. The result of
			clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.
		</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin unit types choices" src="./images/adminUnitTypesDropdown.png" style="width:282">
		<li>Unit Represent. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of what the unit represents. The default choice
			is "quantity". More details are given
			on the <a href="./conversionsUnits.html">information on units</a> page. The result of
			clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.
		</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin unit represent choices" src="./images/adminUnitRepresentDropdown.png" style="width:288">
		<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of who can see a unit and graph it. It is "all"
			(default) if
			everyone can graph with this unit, "admin" if only admins can graph with this unit and "none" if nobody can
			graph with this unit.</li>
		<li>Preferred Display. This dropdown menu can be "yes" (default) or "no". This is currently unused but is
			planned to indicate if this should be a primary unit for
			display to users. </li>
		<li>Sec in Rate. This gives the number of seconds in the unit if "Unit Represent" is flow. It is not used for quantity and
			raw units so the value can just be left as 3600. For example, if the unit is gallons per minute then this
			value is 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute. If it is gallons per hour then this value is 3600
			because there are 3600 seconds in an hour. The default value is 3600. More details are given
			on the <a href="./conversionsUnits.html">information on units</a> page.</li>
		<li>Suffix. If blank then this is not a suffix unit (default). Otherwise, it gives the suffix value. More
			details are
			given
			on the <a href="conversionsUnits.html#suffix">conversion and units</a> page.</li>
		<li>Note. This may give additional information about the unit supplied when OED created it or from the
			admin. Any text can be entered and it can be blank if desired.</li>
