	<h1>Admin Meter Creating (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user. </p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The admin meter creating popup, shown in the following figure, allows admin users to creating a new
		meter on an OED site. It is accessed from
		the <a href="./adminMeterViewing.html">admin meter viewing page</a> by clicking the "Create a
		Meter" button near the top of that page.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Admin meter creating popup" src="./images/adminMeterCreatingPopupOne.png"></p>
	<p><img alt="Admin meter creating popup" src="./images/adminMeterCreatingPopupTwo.png"></p>
	<p>All information shown on this page is based upon the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>As shown in the figure above, the following information can be entered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identifier. This is the "name" of the meter shown when <a href="graphingMeters.html">graphing
				meters</a>. The identifier of a meter must be different from any other meter. If no identifier is
			provided then the name provided is automatically used.</li>
		<li>Name. This is the name of the meter. It is often the same as the identifier but can differ. There are two
			values because OED sometimes needs to internally use a special name that is not very user friendly so the
			identifier is also useful. Sites can also use this name for similar or other reasons when they want
			something other than what is displayed to the user. The name of a meter must be different from any other
			meter. This field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</li>
		<li>Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection of the unit that the meter collects in. This is related
			but different than the <a href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a> used. Some information on the meter
			unit is given on the <a href="exampleDescription.html">help example</a> page. The result of
			clicking this dropdown menu is shown in the following figure.</li>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterUnitDropdown.png" style="width:249">
		<p>All units of meter type will be shown and any one that is compatible with the default graphic unit can be
			selected by clicking it. The compatible/selectable units will be at the top of the dropdown menu and the
			incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. In the following figure, the
			compatible units are in the blue Rectangle and the incompatible units are in the light blue rectangle where
			the
			default graphic unit was already set to kWh.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices separated by compatible and incompatible"
			src="./images/adminMeterUnitDropdownSeparated.png" style="width:249">
		<p>A meter unit is compatible with
			the default graphic unit as long as there is a
			conversion that exists between them. Note that if "no unit" is selected for the default graphic unit then
			every
			unit is compatible with that. Meters can only collect in
			units of meter type and must be linked by a conversion to a regular unit for graphing. There is a choice of
			"no
			unit" on this menu but it is generally not used. If this is selected then the meter can collect data but
			would be unusable for graphics. The default graphic unit is automatically set to "no unit" when the meter
			unit is set to that value. It is mostly used internally to OED for automatically creating meters where
			the unit is not known and then the admin needs to set this unit afterward. If one needs to
			select a different unit that does not have a conversion to the current unit then selecting "no unit" for the
			default graphic
			unit will allow that selection. This field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</p>
		<li>Default Graphic Unit. This dropdown menu allows for the selection a compatible <a
				href="./graphingUnits.html">graphing unit</a>
			that is used if one is not
			already selected before this meter is chosen. A default graphic unit is compatible with the meter unit if a
			conversion exists between them. As with the meter unit, the compatible/selectable units will be at the top
			of the dropdown menu and the
			incompatible/non-selectable ones will be at the bottom in grayed out font. Initially this menu will only
			have "no unit" as compatible because that is the only
			compatible unit with "no unit" as shown in the following figure.</li>

		<img alt="Admin meter default graphic unit choices when no meter unit"
			src="./images/adminMeterDguNoUnitDropdown.png" style="width:248">
		<p>The dropdown menu when the meter unit is already set to Electric_Utility is shown in the following figure.
			All units from Celsius and below are not compatible and grayed out.</p>
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="Admin meter unit choices" src="./images/adminMeterDguEuDropdown.png" style="width:248">
		<p>This field will be outlined in red until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</p>
		<li>Updates. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). If "yes" and OED knows how to automatically
			acquire readings from this meter then it will be done whenever the site automatically acquires readings from
			meters. (See information on <a href="./adminInstallation.html">site installation</a> about automatic meter
			reading acquisition.) If no then no data will automatically be acquired for this meter.</li>
		<li>Displayable. This dropdown menu can be "yes" or "no" (default). "yes" indicates the meter
			can be seen and graphed by any user and "no" limits the meter visibility and graphing to admins.
		<li>Type. This dropdown menu allows for setting the type of a meter which is generally the vendor associated
			with
			it. As the following figure shows, OED currently knows about a few types of meters and can acquire their
			data
			directly. If you want and can to use a meter not on this list then select "OTHER". See the page on <a
				href="./adminDataAcquisition.html">data acquisition</a> for more information. Please <a
				href="../../contact.html">contact us</a> if you want to use meters for that we do not yet support. This
			field will be outlined in red
			until a unit is selected as
			is shown in the figures.</li>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
</div>

<li>Meter Type: This is the type of meter as stored in OED. This information might be useful if you are looking
	for a particular type of meter or to be sure it is the correct type.</li>
<li>Meter Address: This is the IP address to get data if the meter type is MAMAC. It is the address that Obvius
	data came from if the meter type is Obvius.</li>
<li>Meter GPS: This is the latitude and longitude used when placing this meter on a map. You can edit the value
	here. See the <a href="adminMap.html">admin map help</a> for more information on maps.</li>
<li>Meter Updates. This tells if OED tries to automatically gather this meter's data (assuming the site was
	properly set up the do meter updates). At the current time, OED only does this for MAMAC meters. (Obvius
	pushes the data to OED so OED does not need to start that process.) If you have a MAMAC meter in your site
	that you no longer want to collect data, then click the "Disable" button next to the green "Updates Enabled"
	string. The string will change to "Updates Disabled" and go red. The button will become "Enable". Clicking
	that button will reverse the process. (This is also visible to a regular user but they cannot change
	setting.)</li>
<li>Meter Time Zone: This sets the time zone for this meter and overrides the <a href="adminPreferences.html">site
		preferences</a> time zone value.
	This is useful if some meters are not in the same time zone as the site default. See the <a href="time.html">time
		help page</a> for further information.</li>
