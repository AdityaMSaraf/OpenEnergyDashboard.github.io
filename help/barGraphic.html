	<h1>OED Bar Graphic (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>A bar graphic shows each meter and group as a series of fixed time interval bars showing usage across time. The
		following figure shows
		a bar graphic of two meters (??names) and two groups (??names). Each bar represents four weeks of data so it is
		the total usage of the indicated meter/group for those four weeks. Since it is total usage, the units are for
		power??, e.g., kWh for electricity. To get this graphic, you click the "Bar" choice
		(highlighted with a blue box).</p>
	<img alt="sample bar graphic for two meters and two groups" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>A bar graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can control
		the time frame (dates shown) on the bar graphic.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>You select the <a href="graphingMeters.html">meters</a> and/or <a href="graphingGroups.html">groups</a> to graph
		in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as a series of uniquely colored bars. Each bar
		represents the chosen time interval for the bars where the dates are shown below each set of bars. The bars for
		all meters and groups are kept together for the same range of time. If different
		meters and group have data for different time ranges then some bar may not be shown in some time range(s). The
		next figure shows this where the meters ?? do not span the full range of time on the graph. (Note we
		will often use meters in these sample figures
		but the same ideas apply equally to graphs.) In the figure below, you have ?? time ranges from ?? to ?? where
		each range is 28 days/four weeks. The first time range is ?? to ?? and the next is ?? to ?? and this continues
		for all the
		time ranges.</p>
	<img alt="sample line graphic where the meters data is different time frames" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>You can select the time range in days for each bar displayed in two ways. The first involves clicking one of the
		predefined time ranges (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure) where the choices are "Day", "Week" or
		"4 Weeks". The figure below is the result of clicking on the "Week" choice (it was "4 Weeks" in the figures
		above).</p>
	<img alt="sample week bar graphic" src="../images/comingSoon.png">
	<p>The second way to change the bar time range is to click on the "Toggle custom slider" button (highlighted with a
		light blue box in the next figure) to reveal the slider. You can then click and hold the circle (highlighted
		with a blue box) to drag it to the number of days desired where the allowed range is 1 to 365 days. In the
		figure below, the "Toggle custom slider" button was clicked and the circle dragged to 10 days.</p>

	<p>The range of dates used in the bar graphic correspond to the ones selected/used in the line graphic. Thus, if you
		want to change the range of dates included, you need to follow the <a href="lineGraphic.html#scrollZoom">
			steps</a> and do it on the line graphic page.</p>

	<h3 id="barStacking">Bar Stacking</h3>
	<p>There are two types of bar graphics supported. The first is where each meter/group is its own bar. That is what
		has been discussed so far. The second is a stacked bar graphic. In this case, each time interval has a single
		bar with all the meters/groups represented inside this bar as sub-bars. The height of each sub-bar for a given
		meter/group is the proportion of the usage for this meter/group compared to the total for all meters/groups
		displayed. The following figure shows bar stacking where you get this option by checking the box next to the
		"Bar Stacking" label (highlighted with a blue box).</p>

	<h3>Colors of bars</h3>
	<p>The color of each bar or sub-bar is the same as that used in the line and map graphic. The color choice is <a
			href="lineGraphic.html#colors">described here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Exporting graph data</h3>
	<p>You can export the data represented on a bar graphic. See the <a href="export.html">export help page</a> for
		further information.</p>

	<h3>Why 4 weeks?</h3>
	<p>See the <a href="compareGraphic.html#fourWeeks">discussion</a> in compare graphics about why OED uses 4 weeks
		rather than one month.</p>

	<h3>Graphic time range</h3>
	<p>You can set the time range of each bar to any allowed range. This means it may be possible to create a bar
		graphic with a single bar for each meter/group where it is longer than the time of available data. In a somewhat
		related item, note that if
		a bar contains time where the meter/group is missing data then the total usage is likely to be lower than usual.
	</p>

	<h3>Bars with limited data</h3>
	<p>Since the time range for each bar is fixed, the last/latest time bar may partly include time for which there is
		no data.
		For example, if you have a meter with 10 weeks of data and use 4 week time intervals for each bar, the
		third/last bar will have 2 weeks of data (the first two bars took up 8 eights) in the final bar of 4 weeks time
		interval. This can be confusing to the user. We are working on this issue and will address it in a future
		release of OED.</p>

	<h3>Default bar type</h3>
	<p>By default, a bar graphic will begin by not being stacked. The site administrator can change this behavior so the
		default is stacked. In either case the user of OED can change the default during usage.</p>
