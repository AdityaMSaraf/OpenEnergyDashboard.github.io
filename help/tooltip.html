	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>OED provides popup help (tooltips) within the web browser to help users.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Anywhere you see the "?" icon, you can click to get a popup to see help on what is near the icon. This is shown
		in the next figure where the "?" icon is highlighted with a blue box. The "?" icon has been clicked and the help
		tooltip popup is shown.</p>
	<img alt="OED tooptip usage" src="../images/OEDTooltip.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>Normally only one popup is allowed but a few can be shown simultaneously. In general, there is a link to the
		appropriate help website page to give the
		user further information on this part of OED.</p>
