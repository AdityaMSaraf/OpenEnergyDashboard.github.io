	<h1>Admin User (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user.</p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>There are several other admin help pages available:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="adminPreferences.html">Admin Preferences & Upload</a>. This describes how admins can set the site
			preferences.</li>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>In order to access any admin features, you must be logged in as an admin. Click the "Log in" button on the top,
		right side of the OED web browser window (highlighted with blue box in next figure).</p>
	<img alt="admin login button" src="./images/OEDAdminLoginButton.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>Once the "Log in" button is clicked, you will be taken to the login page shown in the next figure. Enter your
		"Email" and "Password" and then click "Submit". If the credentials are correct then a success popup will briefly
		appear and the web browser window will take you back to the main OED screen. If there was an issue then a
		failure popup
		will briefly appear and you will remain on the login page. If you do not know your admin login credentials then
		check with the person who set up your OED site. If you are unable to log in then you can contact us for
		additional help.</p>

	<p>Note you can click the "Log out"
		button in the
		top, right if you want to stop being an admin.
		OED will automatically log you out after a set period of time.</p>
	<p>The pages linked above have information on what you can do as an admin and now to get to each page.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>When your session times out as an admin, the next action you take will redirect you to the login page. After you
		log in you are returned to the main OED page. Then you can click to get back to where you were.</p>
	<p>OED will warn you if you have unsaved changes from admin pages. You can choose to "Cancel" which stays on that
		page but does not save the changes, "Leave" that will leave the page without saving your changes, or "Save
		all" that will save your changes to the database and leave the page. Any unsaved changes will not be permanent and will not be
		seen by users of your site. Note that OED can only detect that changes were made and not if you set them back to
		the original values so you will be warned in this case. Also note that other users will not see changes until
		they reload OED in the web browser.
