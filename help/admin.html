<div>
	<h1>Admin User (Help)</h1>
	<p>Under construction</p>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
		features are not usually of
		interest to a general user.</p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>There are two other admin help pages available:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="adminMeterViewing.html"></href>Admin Meter Viewing</a>. This describes the abilities given to
			admins on the meters page that are not available
			to general users.</li>
		<li><a href="adminGroupViewing.html">Admin Group Viewing</a>. This describes the abilities given to admins on
			the groups page that are not available
			to general users.</li>
		<li><a href="adminMap.html">Admin Map control</a>. This describes the abilities given to admins to set up and
			manage maps.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>In order to access any admin features, you must be logged in as an admin. Click the "Log in" button on the top,
		right side of the OED web browser window (highlighted with blue box in next figure).</p>
	<img alt="admin login button" src="../images/OEDAdminLoginButton.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>Once the "Log in" button is clicked, you will be taken to the login page shown in the next figure. Enter your
		"Email" and "Password" and then click "Submit". If the credentials are correct then a success popup will briefly
		appear and the web browser window will take you back to the main OED screen. If there was an issue then a
		failure popup
		will briefly appear and you will remain on the login page. If you do not know your admin login credentials then
		check with the person who set up your OED site. If you are unable to log in then you can contact us for
		additional help.</p>

	<p>Once you are logged in, the main OED will change as show in the next figure. Click the "Admin Panel" button in
		the top,
		right (highlighted with a blue box) to go to the main admin page. Note you can click the "Log out" button in the
		top, right if you want to stop being an admin.
		OED will automatically log you out after a set period of time.</p>
	<img alt="main OED page for admin" src="../images/OEDMainPageForAdmin.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>You will now be on the main admin page as shown in the next figure. Each area of the page is described below.
		<strong>It is important that you click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page to save your changes to the
			database. If you do not do this, other users will not see the change and it will be gone the next time you
			visit your site or refresh your web browser page with OED.</strong>
	</p>

	<h3>Default Site Title</h3>
	<p>Clicking the box below this label will allow you to enter or edit the OED site title shown at the top of each
		page. You should try to keep the title fairly short so that it does not take up too much space on each page. The
		title will remain blank until you enter one.</p>

	<h3>Default Graph Type</h3>
	<p>When a user first loads OED, you can control the <a href="graphType.html">graph type</a> that will appear. The
		user can still change to another graph type if they wish. The types of graphs you can choose mirror the ones
		allowed. Simply click the circle next to your choice. The default will be "Line" unless you change it.</p>

	<h3>Default Bar Stacking</h3>
	<p>The <a href="barGraphic.html#barStacking">bar stacking</a> option allows the bar graphic to show as single,
		stacked bar for each time frame. By default this is off. You can make it default to on by clicking the box next
		to "Bar Stacking". If checked, you can click to remove this choice.</p>

	<h3>Default Language</h3>
	<p>Clicking one of the languages below this label will set OED to use that language for its strings within the
		application for all users. The default language is "English" until you change it.</p>

	<h3>Import Meter Readings</h3>
	<p>This allows loading of a CSV file to add readings to an existing meter. We are in the process of creating a new
		system for doing this and will document it when it is generally available. If you need information on loading
		reading before then, please contact us.</p>

	<h3>Add new meters</h3>
	<p>The new system that allows for adding readings will also support meters. Thus, treat adding new meters the same
		as readings and contact us.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>The map graphic cannot be made the default graphic type at this time. We expect that will change soon.</p>
	<p>The popup help is set to be language settable but the translations are not yet done. The help pages on the web
		(linked from within the app help) are not translated but may be in the future.</p>
	<p>It is not difficult to include additional languages within OED. If you are willing to translate the strings, we
		can provide a file to type them in that can then be permanently stored with our source code so your site and
		other sites will always have that language. We will also modify OED to show that language choice on the admin
		page. We welcome the addition of languages to OED. If interested then please contact us.</p>
