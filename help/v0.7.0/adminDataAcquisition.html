	<h1>Admin Data Acquisition (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The OED system stores and works with readings. These are normally thought of as meter readings but can come from
		any source. OED has a standard way to acquire these readings but also provides software that can take readings
		from other sources and manipulate them to fit our model of how readings should come to OED. This allows for
		sites to directly acquire readings from a number of sources. Note that it is possible to do this for other meter
		systems. We are willing to either work with you (or another party) to create the needed code or, if it
		seems appropriate, create this code for a new type of device. At the current time OED has systems in place to
		automatically acquire data from CSV files, Obvius AcquiSuite and MAMAC meters. These are described below.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<h3>CSV</h3>
	<p>The standard way OED acquires information about meters and readings is via information in CSV files. Data passed
		in this way goes through the standard data acquisition pipeline where it is checked for a number of possible
		errors/issues before being added into the OED system. The Obvius and MAMAC acquisition described in the next two
		sections are filters that process the data supplied in these vendor's format (mostly CSV in a different format)
		and converted into the canonical CSV format that OED expects for standard processing. The details for uploading
		a CSV file into OED are described
		on the <a href="adminCsvImport.html">admin CSV Import page</a>.</p>
	<h3>Obvius</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.obvius.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obvius
	AcquiSuite</a> acquires meter data using Obvius hardware for a large number of metering devices. The system
	has the ability to provide this data to other systems. OED uses the push mechanism where AcquiSuite periodically
	sends OED this data. As we work with more sites in using Obvius, we plan to provide instructions to let you do
	this yourself. For now, please contact us and we will help you through this process.</p>

	<h3>MAMAC meters</h3>
	<p><a href="http://mamacsys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAMAC meters</a> are hardware devices that collect
		various types of metering data. OED uses its ability to send a CSV file with meter data via a web request. At
		the current time, adding new meters needs to be done on the OED server (no web interface). The directions are
		provided as part of the OED software. Thus, this process is normally done by an IT person where they need a CSV
		file with the IP addresses of the desired MAMAC meters. If you need assistance in doing this then please contact
		us.</p>
