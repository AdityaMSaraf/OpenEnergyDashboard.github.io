	<h1>OED Users (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>OED supports the creation of user roles that allow for:
	<ul>
		<li><i>ADMIN</i>: Can perform any admin feature. This role includes all the privileges of any other user so it
			can
			do those functions as well.</li>
		<li><i>CSV</i>: Can import data into OED via CSV files (see <a href="adminCsvImport.html">CSV import help</a>)
		</li>
		<li><i>EXPORT</i>: Can export data as a CSV from OED even when the file size is larger. (see <a
				href="export.html">export help</a>)</li>
		<li><i>OBVIUS</i>: Can upload Obvius data into OED. (see <a href="adminDataAcquisition.html">data
				acquisition</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	Once a user with the necessary role is created by an admin, that login can be used to complete the allowed action
	for the given user role.
	</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>The main OED admin preferences page (see <a href="adminPreferences.html">admin help</a>) has a button ("Users"
		under the "Manage:" tag) that takes an admin to the user control page as shown in the next figure.</p>
	<img alt="admin user page" src="./images/OEDAdminUsers.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<!-- TODO has default admin that cannot currently delete -->
	<p>This example figure shows four users of oedcsv@mysite.org, oedexport@mysite.org, oedobvius@mysite.org and
		oedadmin@mysite.org with the roles of CSV, EXPORT, OBVIUS and ADMIN, respectively. A user can be removed from
		OED by clicking the "Delete User" button that is in red. Note this action cannot be undone and happens right
		away. The only exception is that you cannot delete an admin user if they are the only one in the OED system. You
		must always have at least one admin user on a site. For all roles, it is fine to have multiple users for that
		role (not shown in figure).</p>
	<p>A new user can be created by clicking the blue "Create a User" button where a new page will open. You type in the
		"Email", "Password" and "Confirm password" in the boxes below those titles. The role is set by selecting from
		the dropdown menu under the "Role" title. The default role is ADMIN unless another is selected. Once all
		informatin is entered then click the "Submit new user" button at the bottom of the page. If successful, then a
		notice will temporarily show in the top, right of the page and you will be returned to the main user page. If
		there is an issue then a message will tell you the problem. If you wish to cancel entering a new user then
		either hit the web browser back button to return to the user page or click another button to go to a different
		OED page. The next figure shows the page after the information was entered to add the CSV role user described
		above.</p>
	<img alt="admin user page" src="./images/OEDAdminCreateUser.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>You can change the role of the user by using the dropdown menu in the "Roles" column to select a new role for the
		user in the row of the table. You must click the green "Submit role changes" button at bottom, right of the page
		for any changes to take effect. This button will go from grayed out green to regular green when a change needs
		to be saved. If you do not save your change(s) then they will be lost when you leave this page.</p>
