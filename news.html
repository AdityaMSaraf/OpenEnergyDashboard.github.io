	<h2>Release of OED version 0.6.0</h2>
	<h3>2 March 2021</h3>
	<p>OED is pleased to announce the release of version 0.6.0. This is the first major release in a while. It
		contains many new features including:</p>

	<h3>Graphics Changes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use Plotly for all graphics which allows for zooming and scrolling in line graphic.</li>
		<li>Added a map graphic to show usage geographically.</li>
		<li>Simplified comparison graphic.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other Changes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Help popups inside OED web pages that link to full help pages.</li>
		<li>OED is now time zone aware. This means that all graphics now show the meter time rather than local time
			which varied by user.</li>
		<li>Support for acquiring meter data from Obvius.</li>
		<li>Created standard pipeline for acquiring data and clear API for its usage.</li>
		<li>Many issues/bugs were addressed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This release marks to continued progress of OED. We expect to have 1-2 more releases over the next half a year
		that will contain new features and enhancements of the current features. OED is moving toward release 1.0 which
		will move OED away from just displaying electricity to being able to display all resource types such as water
		(volume), gas (energy), recycling (weight), etc. OED will also be able to display resources in many ways such as
		usage (kWh, volume, etc.), cost (money), CO2, etc. Sites will be able to use local units for each item, e.g.,
		metric or English units, cost in local currency, etc. While the target date is not yet set we hope this will be
		completed within the year.</p>
