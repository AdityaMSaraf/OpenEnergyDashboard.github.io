	<h3>OED feature enhancement: admin access to expanded information
		in OED</h3>
	<h4>Idea</h4>
	<p>
		There are a number of enhancements being done to OED that requires
		admins to be able to enter/change values. These include added resource
		types (<a href="graphicalResources.html">detailed here</a>) and
		normalized data (<a href="normalized.html">detailed here</a>). We also
		want the admin to be able to modify any meter data. Since these can be
		laborious tasks, having an interface that allows for CVS files to
		contain the data is desired.
	<h4>Implementation</h4>
	<p>OED currently has a very basic admin panel. A systematic way to
		add new inputs and edit these values needs to be developed. This will
		include individual values in text boxes as well as a robust CSV drop
		capability. This should allow for the needed entries in the admin
		panel now and in the future.<p>
		Note one way to edit meter data is to allow someone to download the
		needed meter readings as a CSV file, edit values desired for change,
		and then upload the CSV file. Another GSoC project to allow people to
		<a href="rawData">download raw data</a> would enable this without too
		much work. We already have a way to upload CSV meter data. This should be easier to implement and use then a complex
		interface to let admins access any data point on any meter. The complex interface  is not deemed valuable given this is a feature only for
		admins and will received limited but important usage.
	<h4>Difficulty</h4>
	<p>This should be a fairly easy project where the adding new data
		will make it a little more complex. It is possible to combine this
		project with the download of raw data for a student with sufficient
		knowledge and drive.
