	<h1>History of the Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>The OED project began at Beloit College in the fall of 2016.
		There was a desire to be able to use our energy meters in a variety of
		ways for students, facilities, sustainability projects, and others in an
		inexpensive way where we retained all the data and could customize. We
		were unable to find an available system that met our needs. Instead of
		building an energy dashboard for ourselves, the CS department took on
		this project as open source where we collaborated with others on the
		initial features and what would be wanted in the future. The project
		went public in March 2017. It is still under active development and
		we are continuing to get more partners and users of the system.</p>
