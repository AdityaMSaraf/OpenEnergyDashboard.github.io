title: OED quick install
---
<div>
	<h1>No NPM or Database Install Output</h1>
	<p>If you have previously installed the PostgreSQL database and tell OED to skip installing the node modules then it
		will be faster and skip a number of steps. Below is typical
		output for this process. Please note:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This output was created on 5 Feb 2021 on a Mac. The exact output will vary with machine type and changes to
			OED.</li>
		<li>There are often colors in the output but that is not shown.</li>
		<li>The warning:<br>
			WARNING: could not open statistics file "pg_stat_tmp/global.stat": Operation not permitted<br>
			may or may not show up. It also shows up at other times. The complete answer is not known but it appears to
			be a transient error in PostgreSQL writing log information. It has never caused any problems.</li>
		<li>You may also see the log messages from the last time PostgreSQL ran in the earlier parts of the output.
			These
			could be short or long lists. They might seem to indicate issues but are not related to this attempt to
			install OED.</li>
	</ul>
