	<h1>OED developer map data</h1>
	<p>The following assumes you have loaded the <a href="testData.html">test data</a> into your development OED system.
		You can use other meter data if you prefer.</p>
	<p>Please use the <a href="../help/v0.8.0/adminMap.html">admin map help</a> for information on how to load and
		calibrate a
		map. This page only describes the necessary details of the test map. You need to be logged in as an admin to
		complete these steps.</p>
	<p>Use the sample <a href="testData/HappyPlace.png" download>Happy Place map</a> by downloading it. This
		is the map
		you upload into OED. We will call it "Happy Place" and you can use that name in OED or some other name. The map
		angle is 0.0 degrees.</p>
	<p>During the calibration step, you will use a mythical GPS coordinate system of (0-30, 0-50) which are real GPS
		values but not usual for a map. This large area works because we will make a perfect calibration with no error.
		This means the lower, left corner of the map has GPS coordinate (0, 0) and the top, right has GPS coordinate
		(50, 30). The Plotly grid has values of (0, 0) for lower, left and (300, 500) for the top, right. This means the
		coordinates are reversed for GPS (latitude, longitude) compared to the grid (x, y) and are a factor of 10
		smaller.
		During calibration, click on three places on the map. In principle it does not matter where but I normally click
		in three spread out places on the map. When you do that, OED will tell you the grid coordinate you clicked on.
		As just explained, you need to reverse the coordinates and divide by 10. Thus, if you are told "input GPS
		coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461 in this format -> latitude,longitude" then you enter
		"46.1, 27.7" for the GPS value in the box and submit. Repeat this 3 times and you should then see an error of 0%
		for both directions. If not, start over. If yes, then save changes to the database.
	</p>
	<p>Next go to mater page to edit the meters for the desired GPS locations. These values will work where you don't
		input the location on map but that tells you where it will show up. You can do the same on the groups page.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>GPS: 41.6, 8.5, Location on map: Play Place</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>GPS: 26.8, 25.2, Location on map: Theater</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>GPS: 42.6, 23.4, Location on map: Swimming Pool</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>GPS: 20.2, 8.1, Location on map: Cafeteria</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>GPS: 5.6, 18.9, Location on map: Housing</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can put these on whatever meters/groups you want and can use as many as you want. If all went
		well, you should now
		see the following on the map page where you may have different meters/groups that can change the color of the
		circles and their size.</p>

	<h2>Rotated map</h2>
	<p>Sometimes you want to test a rotated map. In this case use <a href="testData/HappyPlace30Deg.png" download>Happy
			Place 30 Deg map</a> that was rotated by 30 degrees. This does not impact the GPS coordinates but means the
		simple
		correspondence between the OED grid and GPS no longer holds. During calibration, use these points:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bottom, right of Swimming Pool at coordinate 265, 342 with GPS value of 39.5, 27.7</li>
		<li>Bottom, right of Theater at coordinate 217, 234 with GPS value of 23.7, 29.3</li>
		<li>Bottom, right of Cafeteria at coordinate 85, 252, with GPS value of 17.0, 12.7</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This will give: result: x: 3.127%, y: 0.647%. If you switch to this map then you should see the following
		(assuming you put in the meter locations above) with the same caveats listed for the Happy Place map.</p>
