	<h1>OED developer test data</h1>
	<p>Developers want to have test meter data for OED development that is consistent, stable and does not require
		having access to actual meters. This describes how to get and load such meter test data.</p>
	<h2>Doing OED comparison graphs</h2>
	<p>The comparison graphic in OED uses the current time to compare usage over a given period to the same period
		shifted
		by that same period in the past. Since the test data has static dates, they will not include dates near the
		current time. This means that you cannot see comparison data. We will be posting directions to import test data
		that will allow comparison graphs.</p>
	<h2>Future plans</h2>
	<p>OED has developed code to generate mathematically-based meter data that is easy to tell visually if it is
		correct. That data will be coming and allow developers to generate the test data on their own machine rather
		than download it. Also, we will soon update OED to allow for upload of both meters and meter readings
		information
		via a CSV file. We will combine both of these by providing scripts to generate and load desired test data into
		OED. This will greatly simplify the process. When it is available, this page will be updated and it will be
		announced to developers.</p>
</div>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>What follows assumes you have a properly installed and working OED but you may not yet have any meters in OED. At
	a minimum you should be able to see the main OED page in a web browser (normally URL of localhost:3000).
	Normally the database is automatically created and works fine. If you get errors about the database then you
	need to address them before you can do this or get the test data in (if you get errors during this process).
	Finally, these directions are written assuming you are using Docker. It should be possible to do these outside
	Docker. Please let the project know if you are interested in directions for doing that.</p>
<p>The data sets use a fixed meter_id in the database starting at 100 and larger values. It is assumed you have not
	added enough meters to get to this value. Having a fixed id makes debugging easier as you know the value in the
	database. You can modify the meter_id in the CSV but that is not normally done. If you happen to have an overlap
	then you will get an error during loading of the meter data and no meter data will be added to OED.</p>
<h2>Test Data</h2>
<p>The meter CSV file is always small but some readings CSV files can be large so the size is given for those.</p>
<p>Here are the types of test data we have (these files are compatible with the OED database in development as of 8
	January 2021 and we try update them whenever changes are needed):</p>

<p>You will need to download two files in one row for this process: a meter CSV and a readings CSV. Clicking
	on the link in a web browser will download that file.
	Note you can load as many test data files as you want into a single OED instance.</p>
<h2>Loading the data into your OED</h2>
<p>You will want to have OED running during this process. Start it with Docker as you should have previously done. You
	will need
	a second terminal/shell window to run the commands given.</p>
<h3>Where to put the CSV files
</h3>
<p>When you run Docker, it containerizes the work. In order to make the database changes last between runs, the OED
	setup has the database information stored into a file in your OED installation. This is located at &lt;your OED
	main directory&gt;/postgres-data/. The OED main directory is the one with the README.md, etc. When PostgreSQL
	looks for files to load when you use Docker with OED it will look in this directory (&lt;your OED main
	directory&gt;/postgres-data/). Thus, you need to place all the CSV files you will load there. Note that
	depending on your setup (so far only seen on some Linux-based systems), the postgres-data/ directory may not be
	owned by your user and you may not have permission to write on this directory. If this is the case you will need
	to use the superuser (su or sudo) to move the CSV files into that directory.</p>
<h3>How to run the docker-compose commands</h3>
<p>All commands are run in a terminal/shell. You need to be in your main OED directory (the one with README.md,
	etc.) in this terminal/shell.</p>
<p>Note that on some systems you need to do sudo before each docker-compose command. If you needed to do that when
	installing OED then you will need to do that here. It is not shown in the commands given.</p>
<h3>Meters data</h3>
<p>Before you can load in readings, OED needs to have the meters associated with the readings added. These files all
	have ...Meters.csv as the name where ... is the part of the file name that describes the specific test data set.
	Make sure to replace ... with the name of your specific file in each command. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>docker-compose exec database psql -U oed -c "COPY meters FROM '...Meters.csv' CSV HEADER"</code><br>
		This will load the meter information into the database. The output should be a count of rows that equals the
		number of meters being added.</li>
	<li>Go to the web browser displaying OED. Refresh this page. Go to the drop down menu for "Meters:" where you should
		now see the meters included with this test data (included in table above). If you don't see them then something
		is wrong and you should not continue this process and instead ask us for help. (See link at bottom of page)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Readings data</h3>
<p>You will now add readings data for the meters you just added. These files all have ...Readings.csv as the name
	where ... is the part of the file name that describes the specific test data set and the ... should be the same
	as it was for ...Meters.csv . The steps are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>docker-compose exec database psql -U oed -c "COPY readings FROM '...Readings.csv' CSV HEADER"</code><br>This
		will load the readings into the database. The output should be a count of rows that equals the number of
		readings being added for all the meters.</li>
	<li><code>docker-compose run --rm web npm run refreshReadingViews</code><br>This processes the readings within the
		database to optimize for rapid display of data. Note that if you do not do this
		then you will not see the new readings even though they were added to the database.</li>
	<li>Go to the web browser displaying OED. Go to the drop down menu for "Meters:" and select any (or all) of the
		meters
		included with this test data (included in table above). You should see a graphic with the data. For example, the
		threeYear test data currently is shown in OED as:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../images/threeYearGraphic.png" alt="Sample line graphic of three year electric test data"><br>
	If you don't see this then something is wrong and you should not continue this process and instead ask us for help.
	(See link at bottom of page)
</p>
<h2>Creating own data
</h2>
<p>You can download the sample data from the table above. It is important as you edit the files to leave the first
	header line unchanged. Here is how to edit these files:</p>
<ol>
	<li>metersSample.csv: You can set id to anything you want as long as it is not a number of a current meter in
		the database. If it is, you will get an error during the process and the meters will not be added. Make name
		whatever you want to show in the meter list. Give each meter a unique ipaddress but it does not matter what
		it is as long as it is unique. Set the name and identifer to what you want OED to display as the name of
		this meter (both can be the same). The enabled, displayable and meter_type values should stay as they are.
		You can duplicate the second line as many times as you want more meters and edit appropriately.</li>
	<li>readingsSample.csv: Set meter_id to match the id from metersSample.csv for the meter for this reading. Set
		the reading column to the value you want for this reading. Set start_timestamp and end_timestamp to be the
		beginning and end time of the reading. Note that normally the end time of the previous point is equal to the
		start time of the next point in real meter data. You can put in as many lines as you want with readings and
		for any number of valid meters. There are
		two readings in the sample file to show that multiple values are common. Please note that if you don't put in
		readings for a meter then you may get
		unexpected results when you graph that meter in OED.</li>
	<li>Import the data as described above.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>You should now be done and have the test data in your OED development system. If something did not work then you
	can seek help from the project by <a href="mailto:developer@openenergydashboard.org">contacting us</a>.</p>
