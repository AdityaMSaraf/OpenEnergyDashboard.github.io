title: OED test data
---
<div>
	<h1>OED developer test data</h1>
	<p>Developers want to have test meter data for OED development that is consistent, stable and does not require
		having access to actual meters. This describes how to get and load such meter test data.</p>
	<h2>Doing OED comparison graphs</h2>
	<p>The comparison graphic in OED uses the current time to compare usage over a given period to the same period
		shifted by that same period in the past. Since the test data has static dates, they will not include dates near
		the current time. This means that you cannot see comparison data. We will be posting directions to import test
		data that will allow comparison graphs.</p>
	<h2>Maps</h2>
	<p>For using the following data with maps, please see the <a href="testMap.html">test map page</a>.</p>
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>What follows assumes you have a properly installed and working OED but have not yet loaded in the reading data
		described here. If they have already been loaded then the loading step for that meter will be skipped. At a
		minimum you should be able to see the main OED page in a web browser
		(normally URL of localhost:3000). Normally the database is automatically created and works fine. If you get
		errors about the database then you need to address them before you can do this or get the test data in (if you
		get errors during this process).</p>
	<p>The import of this data into OED uses the CSV import feature that is described in the <a
			href="../help/v1.0.0/adminCsvImport.html">CSV import help</a> and pages linked from that page, esp. about
		readings. You do not need to know all those details but can get further information as needed.</p>
	<h2>Inserting the standard OED test data for meters</h2>
	<p>The simple and mathematical test data is created in OED by doing the following (they are described next):</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure you have OED running so it is available to respond to the CSV requests to load the meter data.
		</li>
		<li>Open a terminal in the web/vsc Docker container by right clicking on the web container in the Docker
			extension of VSC and attaching a shell. (Described in the <a href="./gettingStarted.html">getting started
				directions)</a></li>
		<li>In the terminal, run the command <code>npm run testData</code>. This may take a few minutes but when it
			completes there should be new meters with data, new groups, the DB structures are all updated and the CSV
			files used
			will be removed unless there was an error. This generates all
			the standard test data except the one where readings are every minute since that is a large dataset that is
			less frequently used. See the next step before you
			can use the new OED information within the OED web page.</li>
		<li>As we update OED pages, the code is avoiding reloading Redux state every time. Thus, to see all the changes
			in Redux state and to get the array for graphing units, you need to reload an
			existing OED web page. Once done you should see all the test meters/groups and data as described below. If
			this
			does not happen then an error likely occurred so carefully look at the output in your terminal that you used
			above.</li>
		<li>While you can create any group with the test meters, if you want to test that groups aggregate data properly
			then the test data has a special case for that. The testSqSin meter has values for sine squared and
			testSqCos is analogous. The SqSin + SqCos groups below contain the testSqSin and testSqCos meters so the sum
			should be constant at 2.5 and can be used for testing that groups are working as expected. Note the
			amplitude of testSqSin and testSqCos is not 1 so sin^2 + cos^2 does not equal 1 but does equal a constant
			value.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you only want to load some of the data (not the common usage), you can look at package.json for the individual
		commands to insert the mathematical data. The others are so small/fast that they are done as above.</p>
	<h2>Simple Test Data</h2>
	<h3>Meter data</h3>
	<p>The simple/basic test data is not representative of real meter data nor mathematical but it is easy to use. Each
		meter has readings for five days from June 1-5, 2021. All the line graphs should be a straight line where value
		go 1-5 unless otherwise noted in the name. The meters
		and units are based on the simplified example in the <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/DevDocs/blob/main/resourceGeneralization/resourceGeneralization.md#creating-graph">Resource
			Generalization document</a> with the addition of kW (flow data) and Fahrenheit/Celsius (raw data). The
		following table gives the expected values for the line graphs for all units for these simple meters where NA
		indicates that unit is not allowed. The item for each meter/row that is marked with a
		<sup>*</sup>
		indicated the default graphic unit if one is not already selected. Note that the temperature data will not be a
		straight line unless viewed as raw data when graphed. It will vary modestly from that with daily points. Also, a
		meter without a unit cannot be graphed and OED switches the displayable to false in this case. The meter
		"Electric Utility kWh not displayable" can only be seen if logged in as an admin. Note kW and kWh are not
		impacted by a rate change. The Gallon and Gallon flow are so available for testing the rate choices.

	<p>For bar graphs, you can easily check both day and 4-week bars. The 1-week bar is a little strange because the 5
		days cross a week boundary so the first day (June 1) is the only day in the May 26-June 1, 2021 bar and the
		other four days are in the June 2-8, 2021. The values are correct when this is considered. Back to the 1-day bar
		graph. The value can be found by taking the day value on the line graph (shown in the table above) and
		multiplying by 24. For example, Electric Utility kWh as kWh has line values of 1-5 and bar values of 24-120. In
		US Dollars it is 0.115 - 0.575 on line and 2.76-13.8 on bar. This holds for both quantity and flow units. For
		raw units, it does not make sense to do a bar graph. For example, what is the total temperature over time (not a
		good question). For the 4-week bar, it is the sum of the 5 daily bars. For example, the Electric Utility kWh as
		kWh has 1-day bar values of 24, 24, 72, 96, 120 which sums to 360 and is the 4-week bar value.

	<h2>Mathematical Test Data</h2>
	<p>The OED test data generation code can generate sine and cosine based data. It has several advantages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can create on your own machine without needing to download anything.</li>
		<li>The provided script will generate the data and load it into your OED database for use within the system.
		</li>
		<li>Since it has a regular pattern, it is often easy to see issues in graphed data.</li>
		<li>Different datasets can be used to focus on different types of testing.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that the values are shifted so the minimum is 0 since most meter data is like that. It is easy to use this
		data by following these steps</p>
	</p>
	<p>The following table gives a list of the available data and information about it. The meter name assumes you use
		the provided script to load the data. (If you want to generate the test data outside the usual script, the
		&ltcommand name&gt is what you use to create this dataset manually with
		<code>npm run &ltcommand name&gt</command></code> in a web/vsc Docker container terminal. You will then need to
		load
		the reading data into OED as described on the <a href="../help/v1.0.0/adminReadingsImport.html">reading import
			page</a>. The file will have the name indicated and is located in the
		<code>src/server/test/db/data/automatedTests/</code> directory.)

	<h3>Mathematical data</h3>

	<p>he following picture shows the meters test4DaySin, test4HourSin,
		test23MinSin & test15MinSine. It is designed to
		show how the number of points impact the line quality in OED and verify that varied reading rates do not impact
		the OED code. What you see is that the 4 day line is stair step because each group of 4 day points have the same
		value. The other meters are very similar in value. This shows that the daily averaging in OED is accurate. Note
		that in this and all line graphics, you will see the same value as you zoom in to see hourly or even minute
		level points. This is because the data is kW. The only change you will see is in the quality of the graphic if
		you zoom in so tight that you have limited points to graph.<br>

	</p>
	<p>The following picture shows the same meters as above but as a bar graph with 4 week bars. In a perfect world, all
		the bars would have the same value for a given date range. As can be seen, there are small differences where the
		value varies more as the frequency of the readings goes down. This variation is due to the inaccuracy of low
		frequency readings as is normal. Note the last set of bars varies more due to a known issue in how the bar
		lengths are created.<br>

	<p>The following picture shows a line graphic of the sin values for the 7 different amplitudes (1-7). As expected,
		they have the same period with a different amplitude. Plus, it looks nice!<br>

	<p>The following picture is the same meters as above but for a bar graphic of 1 day that is stacked. It shows some
		stair step features due to only having one bar per day but has the same shape as the line graphic. Plus, it also
		looks nice!<br>

	</p>
	<p>The following picture shows a line graphic of a group containing all the sine amplitudes above but with 6
		included twice. OED does not duplicate the values so the sum is a maximum of 28 or 1 + 2 + ... + 7 = 7 * 8 /
		2.<br>
		<img src="./images/testLineAmpGroupDuplicate.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine group with duplicate" width="90%">
	</p>
	<p>The following picture shows a sin and cos with the same amplitude. It should be noted that normally sin and cos
		and phase shifted so the high of one is the low of the other. You do not see that because the values were
		shifted to all be positive.<br>
		<img src="./images/testLineSinCos.png" alt="Sample line graphic of sine and cosine" width="90%">
	</p>
	<p>The following picture shows the meters testSqSin & testSqCos along with a group containing both meters (c2s2). If
		OED is working properly then the group should have a constant value since sin^2 + cos^1 = 1 or the value of the
		amplitude in this case. This is a good test of whether groups work (for simple groups of only two meters). If
		you want to see how accurate OED is then just graph this group and you will see that the value is always 2.5.
		Note it graphs the group without a unit and that was okay because it was chosen after the meters so it uses the
		unit of the meters.<br>

	<p>The following image shows sin with readings every minute. It is a very high quality version of the first picture
		with points that are less frequent. It is zoomed in to a couple of days and the hover shows it is then every
		minute.This data is not automatically generated and is normally only used to test
		OED's speed when there is lots of reading points.<br>

	<h2>Real World Test Data</h2>
	<p>This data can show what happens with actual data. However, it is harder to see when things are off. It is
		provided as an alternative to the mathematical data but will probably be used less now that that data exists.
	</p>
	<p>The table below lists the types of test data we have. The first four all have 3.5 years of electric data but for
		different meters so the values vary. The last one is a sample file that you can edit to create your own data.

	<h2>Using the provided data</h2>
	<p>Choose the file you want where clicking on the link in a web browser will download that file. Note you can load
		as many test data files as you want into a single OED instance.</p>
	<h2>Loading the data into your OED</h2>
	<p>You will want to have OED running during this process. Start it with Docker as you should have previously done.
		Log in as an admin user. Go to the CSV upload page using the "CSV" button in the top, right of the OED web page.
		You should default to the "Readings" tab which is what you want. Now do the following: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter the meter name in the box where the sample graph below used the file name without the extension, e.g.,
			threeYearA for the first file. You can use any name you like.</li>
		<li>Use the "Choose File" button to select the file with the reading data you are uploading.</li>
		<li>Check the "Create Meter" box.</li>
		<li>Check the "Refresh Readings" and "Refresh Hourly Readings" boxes so the readings will be available right
			away for graphing. You can delay doing this until the last upload if you are doing multiple readings files
			to make it a little faster. If you forget to do this then you must manually refresh the readings to graph
			them.</li>
		<li>Click the "Submit CSV Data" button to start the upload. This will take a little while (probably less than
			one minute). A popup window will appear when the upload is done telling you the status. It should be SUCCESS
			without any warnings if all went well. If something went wrong then address the issue. Note if there are
			lots of errors then you need to look at the log or console where OED is running to see them all.</li>
		<li>Reload the web page where OED is running to see the new meter(s).</li>
		<li>Go to the meter page and assign the unit and, if desired, the default graphic unit for each meter. The
			examples make them Electric_utility for the unit and kWh for the default graphic unit.</li>
		<li>Until OED 1.0 fixes issue with not updating structures on meter edits, you need execute
			<code>npm run updateCikAndViews</code> in a terminal in the web container. Then you need to refresh the web
			page with OED.
		</li>
		<li>You should now be able to graph them.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Below is a line graphic with the four 3.5 year meters. If all went well then this is what you should see.</p>
	<img src="./images/threeYearGraphic.png" alt="Sample line graphic of three year electric test data" width="90%"><br>
	<p>If you don't see this then something is wrong and you should not continue this process and instead ask us for
		help. (See link at bottom of page)</p>
	<h2>Using test data in comparison graphs</h2>
	<p>When you do a compare graph, you choose how far from current time you compare. As a result, you need current
		readings and ones immediately before that time to get data for the comparison graph. If you are using meter data
		that does not have this, you will need to create it. Here is how to do it:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get the timezone of your local machine by doing this in the terminal: <code>date +%Z</code>. For what
			follows the timezone is assumed to be CDT but you should change if your timezone differs.</li>
		<li>Note that shifting data to get compare readings within an existing meter can fail. This is because Postgres
			is creating new readings in some order and you can get overlap with existing readings. Also, you may need to
			recreate the compare data on a later day so you have current readings. Thus, it is best to use a meter
			without any readings for the compare readings. This is done by following the directions on the <a
				href="../help/v1.0.0/adminMetersImport.html">meters import help pages</a> to create a new meter. For
			example, to create the meters "compare 1" and "compare 2", you could put this into a CSV file named
			compareMeters.csv:
			<pre> name,ipaddress,enabled,displayable,meter_type,default_timezone_meter,gps,identifier compare 1,,FALSE,TRUE,other,,,compare 1 compare 2,,FALSE,TRUE,other,,,compare 2 </pre>
			You can then import this CSV meter file (assuming you have OED running and have the default admin user)
			with:
			<code>curl localhost:3000/api/csv/meters -X POST -F 'headerRow=true' -F 'gzip=false' -F 'email=test@example.com' -F 'password=password' -F 'csvfile=@compareMeters.csv'</code>.
		</li>
		<li>For what follows, do work in Postgres terminal by attaching a shell to the database container in a similar
			way to how you did it above for the web container. Once inside the database shell, do:
			<code>psql -U oed</code> to access the database terminal. You can then do the following steps within this
			terminal.
			<ol>
				<li>Verify timezone correct by doing: <code>select clock_timestamp() at time zone 'cdt';</code>
					<ul>
						<li>If in daylight savings use: select clock_timestamp() at time zone 'cdt';</li>
						<li>Make sure that it shows the same time as on the clock on your computer that you found in the
							first
							step.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>This assumes that "Meter 1" has the readings you want to add to the "compare 1" meter you created
					above. It
					also grabs the readings from "Meter 1" in the date range of Jan 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020. You can
					change
					the meter names and the date ranges as is appropriate to the data you have. Note it is important
					that the
					reading date range end at least 3 months in the past (assuming you are going to shift 3 months of
					data as
					done below). If not, you will get errors about overlapping data. You can repeat with appropriate
					edits for
					all the meters you want. In this case do:
					<code>insert into readings (meter_id, reading, start_timestamp, end_timestamp)  (select M.id, R.reading, R.start_timestamp, R.end_timestamp from meters as M, readings as R where M.name = 'compare 1' and R.meter_id = (select id from meters where name = 'Meter 1') and R.end_timestamp > '2019-12-31' and R.start_timestamp < '2020-04-01');</code>
				</li>
				<li>The step above created a duplicate of readings into the compare meter. Now you need to shift the
					reading
					dates to end at the current time. First, you need to determine the needed shift in time by:
					<code>select date_trunc('hour', clock_timestamp() at time zone 'cdt') - max(end_timestamp) as shift from readings where meter_id = (select id from meters where name = 'compare 1');</code>
					where you can replace <code>cdt</code> with the appropriate timezone you used above. This will give
					the time
					shift needed so the date of the last end_timestamp is nearest to current hour.
				</li>
				<li>Now shift the readings by this amount (both start and end timestamp where you will shift all
					readings in the
					compare meter). Replace the "509 days 10:00:00" with whatever you got for the shift above. Note you
					have to
					do it in 2 places in the following
					command:<code>update readings set start_timestamp = start_timestamp + interval '509 days 10:00:00', end_timestamp = end_timestamp + interval '509 days 10:00:00' where meter_id in (select id from meters where name in ('compare 1'));</code>.
					You can repeat this step, properly edited, for other meters where the time shift will be the same.
					You can
					also add comma separated meters to the "in" list in the SQL command.</li>
				<li>You can now quit postgres by doing: <code>\q</code></li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>The final step to be able to see the readings on a graph is to refresh the readings. In the terminal in the
			web/vsc Docker container, do: <code>npm run refreshAllReadingViews</code>. You will need to visit the meters
			page or refresh the web page in order the see the new meters.</li>
		<li>You can repeat these steps in the future to get back to the latest time but you may get error about
			overlapping start_timestamp. The easiest way around this is the delete all the reading
			with:<code> delete from readings where meter_id in (select id from meters where name in ('compare 1'));</code>
			and then start again from above to add values and then do the shift (do not need to recreate the meter).
			Note you can edit the list of meters in the "in" list to the actual compare meters you have (comma
			separated) if you want to delete multiple meters' readings. </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Creating own data</h2>
	<p>You can download the sample data from the table above. You can edit the sampleReadings.csv file by opening it in
		you preferred editor where a spreadsheet program is fine as long as you make sure to save it as a CSV file.
		Remove the two sample readings on lines 2 and 3 of the file and create new lines with the data you want. Note
		that normally the end time of the previous point is equal to the start time of the next point in real meter
		data. You can put in as many lines as you want with readings. Please note that if you don't put in readings for
		a meter then you may get unexpected results when you graph that meter in OED. This file has a header row so it
		is easier to see what goes in each column. Once you are done editing and save the file in CSV format, import it
		the same way as the provided data above except you need to check the "Header Row" box since the file has a
		header row. Deal with any messages to correct problems and see the <a
			href="../help/v1.0.0/adminReadingsImport.html">readings import page</a> for more info on dealing with
		issues. Note if there are lots of errors then you need to look at the log or console where OED is running to see
		them all.</p>
	<h2 id="dbIssue">Database issue</h2>
	<p>If you cannot load the data into the database or it disappears after shutting down OED, then you likely have a
		database issue. To test you can do the following: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Log in as the admin.</li>
		<li>Change the default graph type to something else (say bar) and <strong>save the change</strong>. Make sure it
			gives the green popup that it saved okay.</li>
		<li>Refresh the web browser and go tho the main OED page. It should have preselected the bar choice for graphic
			indicating that it is the default choice. If this does not work then verify the admin preference change was
			actually saved without error because it seems your installation is not saving to the database.</li>
		<li>Shut OED down and bring it back up (keeping the database and you can also skip the npm install).</li>
		<li>When OED is done installing, go to the web page and refresh the page. Again, you should see the bar as the
			default selection. If this fails then the database changes are not being saved between runs of OED. This
			indicates an install issue. If you don't know what to do then contact us.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Help</h2>
	<p>You should now be done and have the test data in your OED development system. If something did not work then you
		can seek help from the project by <a href="mailto:developer@openenergydashboard.org">contacting us</a>.</p>
