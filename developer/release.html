	<h1>Preparing an OED Release</h1>
	<p>In preparing for an OED release, the following steps should be followed:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Releases should correspond to a Milestone for the project.</li>
		<li>Announce to the Developer discussion board so everyone can look over the proposed release.</li>
		<li>Review the Milestone for this release to make sure all issues are complete or reassigned.</li>
		<li>See if there are any package or security issues that need to be addressed.</li>
		<li>Do extensive running and testing of OED in a web browser. When possible, test in all major web browsers.
		</li>
		<li>Verify the upgrade from a previous version works using the directions on the latest version of the Admin
			Upgrading help page. This normally means starting from the previous version on a server. Iif not already
			there see the Admin Installation help page on doing this where you will need to load in test data, add
			groups, etc. before upgrading to be sure the database migrates correctly. From the previous version you do
			the upgrade. After the upgrade make sure everything works correctly including the new features.</li>
		<li>Create the GitHub release following the steps in <a
				href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub
				Managing releases in a repository</a>. Note you can save as a draft for later release.</li>
		<li>Add info about release to an OED news items and release pages on the website.</li>
		<li>Celebrate.</li>
	</ol>
