    <h1>Prerequisite steps for WSL on Windows</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your WSL is fully installed correctly, following <a
                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">these steps</a>.</li>
        <li>Make sure Docker is correctly configured to work with WSL, following <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/" rel="noopener noreferrer">these steps</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>According to the best practices given in the <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/#best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker
                WSL
                information</a>, it is best to work in the Linux container rather than the Windows file system. This
            means
            you should clone OED into the Linux file system and run your code environment (such as Visual Studio Code)
            there as well. The information below assumes you have done this and the commands given are run in a Linux
            shell.</strong></p>

    <h1>Errors running <code>docker compose up</code> might throw:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory</code></h2><br>
            Ensure that docker is installed correctly and running - the Docker system tray icon's tooltip should
            specify
            that Docker Desktop is running.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you first install OED, you get some sort of error message (often about not being able to write the
            pg_wal file). This leads to the database going into a panic stop and the database container exiting. When
            this
            has been seen, the web container continues to run and the npm install continues/completes. Note it can take
            a
            while for the npm install to finish but wait and hopefully this will happen. You will likely then get a
            message
            about trying to start to database but nothing after that one line. At this point, stop the install (a
            <strong>single ^c</strong> (control and letter c) or <code>docker compose down</code> in a second terminal
            where it is in the same
            OED
            directory as the install is happening). You should now be back at the command line. Do
            <code>install_args="--keep_node_modules" docker compose up</code> which will try the install again but keep
            the
            node modules (node_modules/ directory) and the Postgres installation (in postgres-data/ directory). Normally
            this will complete the installation fairly quickly without further issues. For now, we encourage you to do
            these exact steps as deviations have been known to cause it to fail. Please note we are looking into
            why
            this is happening but are glad the fix has been working for Windows/WSL developers. If it does not or you
            have
            other issues then please contact us.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Script errors</h2>
    <p>If you have the OED files stored on the Windows file system, then issues will likely occur. It can happen on
        install, when you run checks (linting) and for other OED scripts. This is because the file format is a little
        different. The best solution is to keep all files on the Linux file system (as suggested above). It is possible
        to modify the scripts with but this is not the recommended solution.</p>
