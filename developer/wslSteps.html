    <h1>Prerequisite steps for WSL on Windows</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your WSL is fully installed correctly, following <a
                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">these steps</a>.</li>
        <li>Make sure Docker is correctly configured to work with WSL, following <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl" rel="noopener noreferrer">these steps</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>According to the best practices given in the <a
                href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker
                WSL
                information</a>, it is best to work in the Linux container rather than the Windows file system. This
            means
            you should clone OED into the Linux file system and run your code environment (such as Visual Studio Code)
            there as well. The information below assumes you have done this and the commands given are run in a Linux
            shell.</strong></p>
    <p>We now suspect that all but the first issue may be due to using the Windows rather than the Linux file system
        (see above). We are working to verify this but most of what is listed may not be needed.</p>

    <h1>Errors running <code>docker-compose up</code> might throw:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory</code></h2><br>
            Ensure that docker is installed correctly and running - the Docker system tray icon's tooltip should
            specify
            that Docker Desktop is running.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><code>Docker-credential-desktop.exe executable file not found ...</code></h2>
            If you get a message similar to the one above then it may be <a
                href="https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-credential-desktop-exe-executable-file-not-found-in-path-using-wsl2/100225"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a> (This link was not responding recently but hopefully it is a
            temporary issue as all forums.docker.com are unreachable). As discussed on that page, you should edit the
            ~/.docker/config.json and change <code>credsStore</code> to <code></code>credStore</code>. It is not clear
            why this works but it did help at least one OED developer. A <a
                href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6652">Docker GitHub issue</a> discusses this and some
            found adding an _ worked so <code>credsStore</code> to <code></code>_credsStore</code>. There are also
            proposed changes to the PATH to help. (This <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/7495">Docker
                GitHub issue</a> also discusses this issue.) Overall, this problem seems to be related to changes in
            Docker that impacted its running on multiple system types. Hopefully Docker will resolve this soon (issue
            noticed in February 2021 for OED developers).

            </h2><br>
            Run <code>dos2unix &lt;filename&gt;</code> on the <code>.sh</code> file that causes this error.<br>
            For example: <code>dos2unix installOED.sh</code> and <code>dos2unix src/scripts/devstart.sh</code>

            Edit the following paths in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> under the <code>database:</code> tag
