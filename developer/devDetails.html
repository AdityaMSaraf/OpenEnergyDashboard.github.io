	<h1>OED Developer Information (detailed)</h1>
	<p>There are many details and good ideas to use as an OED developer. This page tries to give you some of them.</p>

	<h2 id="fastInstall">Faster OED installation</h2>
	<p>The easiest way to install OED is to use:
		<br><code>docker-compose up</code><br>
		This is equivalent to the full OED install command of
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh</code><br>
	</p>

	<p>When you do this it does a complete npm package install by first removing the node_modules/ directory.
		Downloading all the needed packages for OED can take many minutes. (<a href="fullInstallOutput.html">full
			install output</a>) You can avoid the package download by using
		<br><code>install_args="--keep_node_modules" docker-compose up</code><br>
		or the full install of
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh --keep_node_modules</code><br>
		It is <strong>very important</strong> to note that this skips updating packages. If you change package.json or
		package-lock.json directly or by pulling in code that does this, you <strong>should not</strong> use this option
		but do the full install above after this and then you can use this faster process. If you do not then you will
		see errors and/or unexpected behavior when OED installs/runs. (<a href="noNPMInstallOutput.html">skipping NPM
			install output</a>)
	</p>

	<h2 id="resetDB">Resetting the Postgres database</h2>
	<p>During the initial install of OED, Postgres detects that you have not run before for this install and initializes
		the database system. It keeps the information in the postgres-data/ directory in the main OED directory. If you
		or a pull changes the database configuration, it will not automatically be changed on the next OED install. When
		we change versions of OED we use a migration system to upgrade the database but this may not be available during
		the development cycle. Given this, it is often easiest to force Postgres to reinitialize the database. Note that
		doing this will wipe out any data (meter, readings, preferences, etc.) that you have for this instance of OED.
		If you wish to force Postgres to reinitialize then do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the postgres-data/ directory from the main OED directory. While you can delete it, it is probably
			safer to move the entire directory somewhere else outside your OED directory. That way, if something goes
			wrong, you can remove the new postgres-data/ directory and put this one back.</li>
		<li>Do an install of OED. Remember if package changes were made then you need to reinstall the node_modules. In
			this case, do not use the keep_node_module option. Note the install will take longer do to the extra
			initialization.</li>
		<li>Sometimes the first attempt at installation will fail when you do this. Try it one or two times more to see
			if it will work. (We are trying to determine why this happens.) If not, replace the postgres-data/ directory
			with the one removed and this should get you
			running but will not give you a new version of the database. If you have this issue then contact us for
			help (see link at bottom of page).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>OED runs in the containerized Docker environment. This means the software and files created are within this
		container and disappear when you stop running OED (shut the container down). The one exception to this rule is
		the information stored in the PostgreSQL database. Because this information needs to exist between OED runs to
		keep the database initialization and OED data, the information is kept within your OED installation in the
		postgres-data/ directory on your machine's file system. This is why removing the postgres-data/ directory resets
		the database within the Docker container.</p>

	<h2 id=goingOn>Seeing what is happening with OED</h2>
	<p>Sometimes OED will not act as you expect and you want to know what is going on. There are two normal ways to do
		this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The terminal where you started OED should show any errors, messages, etc. that are produced while it is
			running. It is a good idea to be able to see this while you are running a version you are developing so you
			can tell when something significant happens. The messages can be informational where these are
			normal and not an indication of a problem.</li>
		<li>OED has the log file "log.txt" in the main OED directory. All message should be placed in this file. The
			newest messages are at the end. This file can get large over time so you probably want to focus on lines in
			the time frame you are interested (they should be timestamped).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The warning:<br>
		WARNING: could not open statistics file "pg_stat_tmp/global.stat": Operation not permitted<br>
		may or may not show up in the output. The complete answer is not known but it appears to
		be a transient error in PostgreSQL writing log information. It has never caused any problems.</p>

	<h2 id=codeChange>Getting a running OED to recognize code changes</h2>
	<p>As a developer, you are often changing the code to see what impact it has on a running version of OED. In
		general, the system should recognize these changes and update the running version. When that happens, in the
		terminal where you started OED, you see:
	</p>
	<pre>
web_1       |  94% after seal                                                                 
web_1       | [at-loader] Checking started in a separate process...
95% emitting 
web_1       | [at-loader] Ok, 0.006 sec.
	</pre>
	<p>Where the % shown will vary and sometimes it says "seal" instead of "emitting". The update can start almost
		immediately after a saved file or it can take a modest amount of time. If it does not happen, you can restart
		the system (forces the update) by typing "rs" in the terminal where the output from OED is showing and you
		started OED. This is indicated during the install from the line:<br>
		[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`<br>
		Note that once the at-loader ok line is seen, you may need to reload your web page to see changes. Whether this
		is necessary depends on what was changed (normally server vs client code).</p>

	<h2 id=migrate>Migrating OED</h2>
	<p>The script <code>src/scripts/updateOED.sh</code> should update all dependencies and migrate the OED database if
		changes are needed. This may not work (see ideas above) if migrations are not yet available or this has been
		done
		before for the same version of OED.
	</p>

	<h2>Having multiple versions of OED</h2>
	<p>Most developers keep one clone of the OED software. They switch between branches as needed. However, if you are
		working on multiple versions of OED, esp. where the node modules are changing or the database configuration
		changes, then you can avoid having to do a full install (see above) by cloning separate copies of OED. When you
		install it will do the clone you are currently located in (the current directory in your terminal). The database
		information and all code is kept separate for each installation as part of the Docker containerization.</p>

	<h2 id="singleTest">Rapid testing of a one or a few test(s)</h2>
	<p>When you make changes to OED or develop new tests, it may be the case that only one or a few tests fails when you
		run
		testing (or you want to focus on one test at a time that fails). Running all the tests is much slower than
		running a single test. Thus, to run a single test, do:
		<br><code>docker-compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- &ltfirst test&gt [&ltsecond test&gt]
		</code><br>where you replace &lt xxxx test&gt with the path to the test you want to run and [ ] indicates this is
		optional and you can repeat as many times as you want for more tests.
	</p>
	<p>For example, to run the web groups test, you would
		use:<br><code>docker-compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- src/server/test/web/groups.js</code><br>and to run
		the web groups test and the db baselineTests
		use:<br><code>docker-compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- src/server/test/web/groups.js src/server/test/db/baselineTests.js</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Database timeout on testing</h2>
	<p>Sometimes when you run the OED tests for the first time in a while, you get an error about the database timing
		out. If this happens, rerun the test command. It normally works the next time (or within a total or three
		tries). We are working to change our testing and installation so Postgres is ready before operations continue so
		this problem will go away.</p>

	<h2>Running without the database container</h2>
	<p>On rare occasions, you may get a database failure during the startup of the database container during the
		install/startup of OED. (This is not the transient issues noted during the install where the script reports it
		is continuing). Generally OED will tell you an issue happened in the console output and Docker indicates the
		database container is not running. In general, the underlying issue should be addressed so you have a correct
		OED installation. (This happened, for example, during Windows WSL installs until an file permission issue was
		resolved.) In rare circumstances, you still want to run the OED web container knowing that any
		operations that touch the database will fail. There is a parameter to the install script that allows this and
		can be done with:
		<br><code>install_args="---continue_on_db_error" docker-compose up</code><br>
		or the full install script (not using docker-compose up) of
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh --continue_on_db_error</code><br>
		OED will still try to install the DB, fail and then continue to try to install the web container. You should see
		the regular messages in the console indicating the web container is running as expected.
	</p>

	<h2 id=typescript>TypeScript Wisdom</h2>
	<p>TypeScript is great, but sometimes it requires some rather strange incantations, especially when working with
		external libraries. We cannot provide information on everything you need to know but here is one of interest:
	</p>

	<h3>Regarding <code>InjectedIntlProps</code> from <code>react-intl</code></h3>
	<p>When using <code>react-intl</code>'s higher order component functionality, some incantations are required. When
		defining a component, it's necessary to express that the component's props are actually (your props) ∪
		(internationalization injector). This can be done via the <code>&amp;</code> operator, as follows:</p>
	<pre>
interfaceSomeProps {
    prop1: number;
}

interfaceSomeState {
    state1: number;
}

class SomeComponent extends React.Component&lt;SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps, SomeState&gt; {
    constructor(props: SomeProps: &amp; InjectedIntlProps) {
        super(props);
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

export default injectIntl&lt;SomeProps&gt;(SomeComponent);
</pre>

	<p>If the union type is used often, it might be cleaner to create a type alias:</p>

	<pre>
type SomePropsWithIntl = SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps;
</pre>
