	<h1>OED Developer Information (detailed)</h1>
	<p>There are many details and good ideas to use as an OED developer. This page tries to give you some of them.</p>

	<h2>Rebuild after Docker dependency changes</h2>
	<p>If a "From" in a Dockerfile is changed, then the version of that software needs to be updated. Docker normally
		uses its cached version so the update will not happen. To force the update, do
		<code>docker compose up --build</code> where you can add other arguments (such as keeping the node modules).
		This should make Docker use what is specified in the Dockerfile. If there are no changes then it will not
		download a new version of the needed software but it will be a little slower for the checks and potentially
		creating the container. OED tries to announce to the Developer Discussion board whenever a change is make to a
		Dockerfile that would require this action.
	</p>

	<h2 id="resetDB">Resetting the Postgres database</h2>
	<p>During the initial install of OED, Postgres detects that you have not run before for this install and initializes
		the database system. It keeps the information in the postgres-data/ directory in the main OED directory. If you
		or a pull changes the database configuration, it will not automatically be changed on the next OED install. When
		we change versions of OED we use a migration system to upgrade the database but this may not be available during
		the development cycle. Given this, it is often easiest to force Postgres to reinitialize the database. Note that
		doing this will wipe out any data (meter, readings, preferences, etc.) that you have for this instance of OED.
		If you wish to force Postgres to reinitialize then do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the postgres-data/ directory from the main OED directory. While you can delete it, it is probably
			safer to move the entire directory somewhere else outside your OED directory. That way, if something goes
			wrong, you can remove the new postgres-data/ directory and put this one back.</li>
		<li>Do an install of OED. Remember if package changes were made then you need to reinstall the node_modules. In
			this case, do not use the keep_node_module option. Note the install will take longer do to the extra
			initialization.</li>
		<li>Sometimes the first attempt at installation will fail when you do this. Try it one or two times more to see
			if it will work. (We are trying to determine why this happens.) If not, replace the postgres-data/ directory
			with the one removed and this should get you
			running but will not give you a new version of the database. If you have this issue then contact us for
			help (see link at bottom of page).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>OED runs in the containerized Docker environment. This means the software and files created are within this
		container and disappear when you stop running OED (shut the container down). The one exception to this rule is
		the information stored in the PostgreSQL database. Because this information needs to exist between OED runs to
		keep the database initialization and OED data, the information is kept within your OED installation in the
		postgres-data/ directory on your machine's file system. This is why removing the postgres-data/ directory resets
		the database within the Docker container.</p>

	<h2>Stopping OED</h2>
	<p>If you go to the terminal where OED is running, you can type ^-c (control and letter c) together to stop OED.
		Note it is best to only do this once since a second time causes a force stop. An alternative is to use
		<code>docker compose down</code> in a second terminal that is in the same directory as where the install is
		happening. This can also be useful if you are having an issue with your docker container(s) since it cleans them
		all up.
	</p>
	<p>Normally, doing ^-z will put the process into the background. This does not work with a running OED.</p>

	<h2 id=goingOn>Seeing what is happening with OED</h2>
	<p>Sometimes OED will not act as you expect and you want to know what is going on. There are two normal ways to do
		this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The terminal where you started OED should show any errors, messages, etc. that are produced while it is
			running. It is a good idea to be able to see this while you are running a version you are developing so you
			can tell when something significant happens. The messages can be informational where these are
			normal and not an indication of a problem.</li>
		<li>OED has the log file "log.txt" in the main OED directory. All message should be placed in this file. The
			newest messages are at the end. This file can get large over time so you probably want to focus on lines in
			the time frame you are interested (they should be timestamped).</li>
		<li>Using the Redux debugging tools in the web browser is also very valuable. It can also help to look at the
			traces. To do this you must enable it in the code. Go to src/client/app/index.tsx and do what the comments
			say to enable traces (comment out one line and uncomment two lines below). Please make sure you do not
			commit this change/include in a pull request. As the comments indicate, it would be nice to automate this
			process and maybe a developer will do this work and submit a PR.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The warning:<br>
		WARNING: could not open statistics file "pg_stat_tmp/global.stat": Operation not permitted<br>
		may or may not show up in the terminal where you started OED. The complete answer is not known but it appears to
		be a transient error in PostgreSQL writing log information. It has never caused any problems.</p>

	<h2 id=codeChange>Getting a running OED to recognize code changes</h2>
	<p>As a developer, you are often changing the code to see what impact it has on a running version of OED. In
		general, the system should recognize these changes and update the running version. When that happens, in the
		terminal where you started OED, you see:
	</p>
	<pre>
web_1       |  94% after seal                                                                 
web_1       | [at-loader] Checking started in a separate process...
95% emitting 
web_1       | [at-loader] Ok, 0.006 sec.
	</pre>
	<p>Where the % shown will vary and sometimes it says "seal" instead of "emitting". The update can start almost
		immediately after a saved file or it can take a modest amount of time. If it does not happen, you can restart
		the system (forces the update) by typing "rs" in the terminal where the output from OED is showing and you
		started OED. This is indicated during the install from the line:<br>
		[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`<br>
		Note that once the at-loader ok line is seen, you may need to reload your web page to see changes. Whether this
		is necessary depends on what was changed (normally server vs client code).</p>

	<h2>OED environment variables</h2>
	<p>If you want to know about the environment variables that control OED then see the <a
			href="./environment.html">environment page</a>.</p>

	<h2>OED Scripts</h2>
	<p>OED has a number of scripts that are run via commands in the package.json file. A complete listing with
		descriptions is on the <a href="npm.html">NPM script</a> page.</p>

	<h2 id=migrate>Migrating OED</h2>
	<p>The script <code>src/scripts/updateOED.sh</code> should update all dependencies and migrate the OED database if
		changes are needed. This may not work (see ideas above) if migrations are not yet available or this has been
		done
		before for the same version of OED.
	</p>

	<h2>Having multiple versions of OED</h2>
	<p>Most developers keep one clone of the OED software. They switch between branches as needed. However, if you are
		working on multiple versions of OED, esp. where the node modules are changing or the database configuration
		changes, then you can avoid having to do a full install (see above) by cloning separate copies of OED. When you
		install it will do the clone you are currently located in (the current directory in your terminal). The database
		information and all code is kept separate for each installation as part of the Docker containerization.</p>

	<h2 id="singleTest">Rapid testing of a one or a few test(s)</h2>
	<p>When you make changes to OED or develop new tests, it may be the case that only one or a few tests fails when you
		run
		testing (or you want to focus on one test at a time that fails). Running all the tests is much slower than
		running a single test. Thus, to run a single test, do:
		<br><code>docker compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- &lt;first test&gt; [&lt;second test&gt;]
		</code><br>where you replace &lt; xxxx test&gt; with the path to the test you want to run and [ ] indicates this is
		optional and you can repeat as many times as you want for more tests.
	</p>
	<p>For example, to run the web groups test, you would
		use:<br><code>docker compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- src/server/test/web/groups.js</code><br>and to run
		the web groups test and the db baselineTests
		use:<br><code>docker compose run --rm web npm run testsome -- src/server/test/web/groups.js src/server/test/db/baselineTests.js</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Accessing the database</h2>
	<p>You can access the Postgres database that OED uses within the docker container. In a second terminal (the first
		should have OED running), do <code>docker compose exec database psql -U oed</code>. You will now be in the
		Postgres command line for the OED database. Note this is the live system so you can make changes that the
		running application will see (and damage the information too!). It is assumed you know some SQL and Postgres
		command line commands if you are doing this. One important one is <code>\q</code> which will get you back to the
		terminal by leaving the Postgres command system.</p>
	<p>There may be times you want to backup/restore the Postgres data for OED. You can do it by</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Take a database dump with
			<code>docker compose exec database pg_dump -U oed &gt; dump_$(date +%Y-%m-%d"_"%H_%M_%S.sql)</code>
		</li>
		<li>Restore a database dump by first copying the dump into the container with
			<code>docker cp /path/to/dump.sql container_name:/dump.sql</code> and then restoring it into the
			database
			with <code>docker compose exec database psql -U oed -f /dump.sql</code>. The /path/to/dump.sql is the file
			with date & time created in the dump step. Note someone should test/see if you
			really need to put it into the container first.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Database timeout on testing</h2>
	<p>Sometimes when you run the OED tests for the first time in a while, you get an error about the database timing
		out. The message is normally something similar to "Error: Timeout of 15000ms
		exceeded. For async tests and hooks, ensure "done()" is called; if returning a Promise, ensure it resolves." If
		this happens, rerun the test command. It normally works the next time (or within a total or three
		tries). We are working to change our testing and installation so Postgres is ready before operations continue so
		this problem will go away. The current fix is to allow a test to take up toe 15,000 ms or 15 seconds to complete
		so Postgres has time to start up and that is why you see "15000ms" in the error message. If the problem
		persists, you can go into package.json and change the 15000 to be a larger value (such as 30000). This means
		mocha will not terminate a test until 30 seconds have passed. The only known negative of doing this is that a
		test that will not complete due to an error will take longer for mocha to terminate. However, this is uncommon
		in OED tests so the change should be fine.</p>

	<h2 id=npmPermission>check permission error</h2>
	<p>A few developers have reported that when they run <code>docker compose run --rm web npm run check</code> they get
		an error similar to "Error: EACCES: permission denied, scandir '/root/.npm/_logs". The only current fix is to
		run outside of docker by doing <code>npm run check</code>. It is believed that this issue is due to doing
		installs as root and then not being root when inside docker but this is not certain. However, at least one
		developer found that changing the file permissions did not fix the issue. If anyone has this issue or finds a
		solution then please let us know.</p>

	<h2>Running without the database container</h2>
	<p>On rare occasions, you may get a database failure during the startup of the database container during the
		install/startup of OED. (This is not the transient issues noted during the install where the script reports it
		is continuing). Generally OED will tell you an issue happened in the console output and Docker indicates the
		database container is not running. In general, the underlying issue should be addressed so you have a correct
		OED installation. (This happened, for example, during Windows WSL installs until an file permission issue was
		resolved.) In rare circumstances, you still want to run the OED web container knowing that any
		operations that touch the database will fail. There is a parameter to the install script that allows this and
		can be done with:
		<br><code>install_args="---continue_on_db_error" docker compose up</code><br>
		or the full install script (not using docker compose up) of
		<br><code>docker compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh --continue_on_db_error</code><br>
		OED will still try to install the DB, fail and then continue to try to install the web container. You should see
		the regular messages in the console indicating the web container is running as expected.
	</p>

	<h2 id="fastInstall">Faster OED installation</h2>
	<p>The installation process was updated in late February 2022 so the node modules are not updated unless needed.
		This means the node modules will only be updated if the package.json and/or package-lock.json file is update
		whether by directed edit or from pulling updating versions. As a result, the old method of
		<code>install_args="--keep_node_modules" docker compose up</code> should not be needed if you are running
		current versions of OED software. The <code>keep_node_modules</code> parameter was left for backward
		compatibility and in the unlikely case where a developer wishes to use it. As expected, the steps and output is
		different when there is no node module installation as seen in <a href="noNPMInstallOutput.html">skipping NPM
			install output</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id=typescript>TypeScript Wisdom</h2>
	<p>TypeScript is great, but sometimes it requires some rather strange incantations, especially when working with
		external libraries. We cannot provide information on everything you need to know but here is one of interest:
	</p>

	<h3>Regarding <code>InjectedIntlProps</code> from <code>react-intl</code></h3>
	<p>When using <code>react-intl</code>'s higher order component functionality, some incantations are required. When
		defining a component, it's necessary to express that the component's props are actually (your props) ∪
		(internationalization injector). This can be done via the <code>&amp;</code> operator, as follows:</p>
	<pre>
interfaceSomeProps {
    prop1: number;
}

interfaceSomeState {
    state1: number;
}

class SomeComponent extends React.Component&lt;SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps, SomeState&gt; {
    constructor(props: SomeProps: &amp; InjectedIntlProps) {
        super(props);
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

export default injectIntl&lt;SomeProps&gt;(SomeComponent);
</pre>

	<p>If the union type is used often, it might be cleaner to create a type alias:</p>

	<pre>
type SomePropsWithIntl = SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps;
</pre>

</div>
