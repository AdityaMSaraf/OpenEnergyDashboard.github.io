	<h1>OED Developer Information (detailed)</h1>
	<p>There are many details and good ideas to use as an OED developer. This page tries to give you some of them.</p>

	<h2 id="fastInstall">Faster OED installation</h2>
	<p>The easiest way to install OED is to use:
		<br><code>docker-compose up</code><br>
		This is equivalent to the full OED install command of
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh</code><br>
	</p>

	<p>When you do this it does a complete npm package install by first removing the node_modules/ directory.
		Downloading all the needed packages for OED can take many minutes. You can avoid the package download by using
		<br><code>install_args="--keep_node_modules" docker-compose up</code><br>
		or the full install of
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run src/scripts/installOED.sh --keep_node_modules</code><br>
		It is <strong>very important</strong> to note that this skips updating packages. If you change package.json or
		package-lock.json directly or by pulling in code that does this, you <strong>should not</strong> use this option
		but do the full install above after this and then you can use this faster process. If you do not then you will
		see errors and/or unexpected behavior when OED installs/runs.
	</p>

	<h2 id="resetDB">Resetting the Postgres database</h2>
	<p>During the initial install of OED, Postgres detects that you have not run before for this install and initializes
		the database system. It keeps the information in the postgres-data/ directory in the main OED directory. If you
		or a pull changes the database configuration, it will not automatically be changed on the next OED install. When
		we change versions of OED we use a migration system to upgrade the database but this may not be available during
		the development cycle. Given this, it is often easiest to force Postgres to reinitialize the database. Note that
		doing this will wipe out any data (meter, readings, preferences, etc.) that you have for this instance of OED.
		If you wish to force Postgres to reinitialize then do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the postgres-data/ directory from the main OED directory. While you can delete it, it is probably
			safer to move the entire directory somewhere else outside your OED directory. That way, if something goes
			wrong, you can remove the new postgres-data/ directory and put this one back.</li>
		<li>Do an install of OED. Remember if package changes were made then you need to reinstall the node_modules. In
			this case, do not use the keep_node_module option. Note the install will take longer do to the extra
			initialization.</li>
		<li>Sometimes the first attempt at installation will fail when you do this. Try it one or two times more to see
			if it will work. (We are trying to determine why this happens.) If not, replace the postgres-data/ directory
			with the one removed and this should get you
			running but will not give you a new version of the database. If you have this issue then contact us for
			help (see link at bottom of page).</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<h2 id=migrate>Migrating OED</h2>
	The script <code>src/scripts/updateOED.sh</code> should update all dependencies and migrate the OED database if
	changes are needed. This may not work (see ideas above) if migrations are not yet available or this has been done
	before for the same version of OED.
	<p></p>

	<h2>Having multiple versions of OED</h2>
	<p>Most developers keep one clone of the OED software. They switch between branches as needed. However, if you are
		working on multiple versions of OED, esp. where the node modules are changing or the database configuration
		changes, then you can avoid having to do a full install (see above) by cloning separate copies of OED. When you
		install it will do the clone you are currently located in (the current directory in your terminal). The database
		information and all code is kept separate for each installation as part of the Docker containerization.</p>

	<h2 id="singleTest">Rapid testing of a single test</h2>
	<p>When you make changes to OED or develop new tests, it may be the case that only one test fails when you run
		testing (or you want to focus on one test at a time that fails). Running all the tests is much slower than
		running a single test. Thus, to run a single test, edit the package.json file in the main OED directory.
		Duplicate the line inside the "scripts" section near the top that tell npm how to run the test (so you have this
		line twice in a row):
		<br><code>test": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha --timeout 15000 \"src/server/test/**/*.js\"",</code><br>
		Now edit one of the duplicated lines to rename the test (whatever you want) and indicate which test file you
		want to run. For
		example, to name the way to run the test as "testone" and to run the test file "compressedReadingsRouteTests.js"
		in routes you would edit the line to be:
		<br><code>"testone": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha --timeout 15000 \"src/server/test/routes/compressedReadingsRouteTests.js\"",</code><br>
		Now change how you run the test to
		<br><code>docker-compose run --service-ports --rm web npm run testone</code><br>
		and just that test file should run. You can edit this new line to run another test file or create another line
		for that one. Please be sure you remove the lines you added to package.json before creating a pull request to
		place changes into the OED code base.
	</p>

	<h2>Database timeout on testing</h2>
	<p>Sometimes when you run the OED tests for the first time in a while, you get an error about the database timing
		out. If this happens, rerun the test command. It normally works the next time (or within a total or three
		tries). We are working to change our testing and installation so Postgres is ready before operations continue so
		this problem will go away.</p>

	<h2 id=typescript>TypeScript Wisdom</h2>
	<p>TypeScript is great, but sometimes it requires some rather strange incantations, especially when working with
		external libraries. We cannot provide information on everything you need to know but here is one of interest:
	</p>

	<h3>Regarding <code>InjectedIntlProps</code> from <code>react-intl</code></h3>
	<p>When using <code>react-intl</code>'s higher order component functionality, some incantations are required. When
		defining a component, it's necessary to express that the component's props are actually (your props) âˆª
		(internationalization injector). This can be done via the <code>&amp;</code> operator, as follows:</p>
	<pre>
interfaceSomeProps {
    prop1: number;
}

interfaceSomeState {
    state1: number;
}

class SomeComponent extends React.Component&lt;SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps, SomeState&gt; {
    constructor(props: SomeProps: &amp; InjectedIntlProps) {
        super(props);
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

export default injectIntl&lt;SomeProps&gt;(SomeComponent);
</pre>

	<p>If the union type is used often, it might be cleaner to create a type alias:</p>

	<pre>
type SomePropsWithIntl = SomeProps &amp; InjectedIntlProps;
</pre>
