	<h3>OED feature enhancement: graphical display of resources</h3>
	<h4>Idea</h4>
	<p>OED started by working with electrical data as a proof of
		concept and to support the resource with the greatest demand. With
		that complete, OED is generalizing to support any resource such as
		natural gas, water, steam, recycling, temperature, etc. Instead of
		addressing these as individual cases, OED is being modified to store
		information about compatible resources (energy, power, volume,
		temperature, etc.) and how to convert between them. This will allow
		OED to address several feature requests with this single change
		including:
	<ul>
		<li>Allow arbitrary resource units (natural gas, energy, power,
			etc.).
		<li>Allow sites to choose the unit for graphical display where
			the most common request is for English vs. metric units.
		<li>Allow OED to display usage in units not associated with
			resource consumption such as CO<sub>2</sub>, equivalent miles of
			driving a car, etc., which may be more natural to some users and
			allow for common sustainability units to be used.
		<li>Allow OED sites to add new units to the system that are not
			automatically supplied with OED
	</ul>
	<p>
		The idea behind the system is that all compatible resources can be
		converted from one to the other via a linear transformation. For
		example, 1 BTU is 2.93x10<sup>-4</sup> KWh. Not all conversions are
		multiplicative factors due to temperature where Fahrenheit = 1.8 *
		Celsius + 32. OED will internally store all data in SI units and then
		convert to the requested unit for display or download.
	<h4>Implementation</h4>
	<p>New tables will be added to the database to store the linear
		transformations and which resource units are compatible. An API and
		code will be created to do the necessary transformations. OED aims to
		be very responsive to users and display any graphic in one second or
		less on any reasonable device. To accomplish this, computation on the
		data is performed on the server and generally done within the SQL
		queries. This allows the server to do the work and also allows OED to
		reduce the number of data points sent to the user to the smallest
		possible for graphing and thereby substantially reduce the network
		payload. Once completed, options will be added to the pages that
		graphically display data to allow for choosing the desired unit. The
		new API will be used to transform the data as needed for the desired
		graphic. The display of the data will be similar to the current
		graphics except the labels need to be updated for more general
		resource units.
	<p>
		The next step would be to modify the admin panel to allow for the site
		to set default units for graphics. The most common request here is
		English vs. metric units. Note that if another GSoC project to enhance
		the <a href="admin.html">admin panel</a> is ongoing then this task
		could be completed as part of that project.
	<p>If this is completed, the graphical display can be modified to
		display multiple resources at the same time. A common request in this
		area is to show gas or electrical usage with temperature (or degree
		heating/cooling day which is a transformation of temperature) since
		one would expect usage for heating and cooling to be impacted by
		temperature. Part of this process will be mocking up ways to show
		multiple unit axes and seeing what users prefers.
	<p>A final change would be to allow an admin to enter new
		units/transformation that can be stored and used in that OED site. As
		above, the actual admin page might be modified by another ongoing
		project.
	<h4>Difficulty</h4>
	<p>This enhancement includes changes to both the front-end and
		back-end of OED by touching database queries, the data API and the
		Plotly graphical package and involves a number of technologies. What
		will make it somewhat easier is the new code will be based on existing
		code. As such, it is likely to be a medium difficult project.
