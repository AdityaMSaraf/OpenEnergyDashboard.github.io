	<h1>Getting involved in the Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>There are many way to be involved in the OED project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Evaluate the energy dashboard during its development. This
			would mean early access to features for your comment. This can be by
			looking at our development system or plans/mockups of new ideas. Please <a
			href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact us</a> if you are interested.
		</li>
		<li>You can provide feedback on proposed designs for the energy
			dashboard including graphics, data stored, admin features, etc.
			Please <a href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact us</a> if you are
			interested.
		</li>
		<li>Be involved in the development of the energy dashboard. This
			could be anything from coding to language translation. Please <a
			href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact us</a> if you are interested.
			You also should sign a <a
			href="https://goo.gl/forms/nR9MtVHUOqYn8WbP2" target="_blank">Contributers
				License Agreement</a> for the project to continue to legally protect
			this as open source under the MPL. The CLA must be in place before
			you can contribute to the OED project.
			<ul>
			<li>Joining a project can be daunting. This project is managed by an educational
			institution and is welcoming to new people. The <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/issues"
			target="_blank">issues list on GitHub</a> has the tag 
			"good first issue" to indicate it would be something that a new contributer might
			find doable. We strongly encourage you to contact us and/or put a comment in an issue before you begin work
			so we know it is being worked on. We work with each person to get them integrated
			into the project. So, please feel free to <a href="mailto:oed@beloit.edu">contact us</a> and you will be welcomed.
			</li>
			</ul>
