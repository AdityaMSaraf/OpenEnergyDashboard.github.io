	<h3>2019 GSoC Ideas List for the Open Energy Dashboard</h3>

	The Open Energy Dashboard (OED) supports the sustainability community
	by providing a free energy dashboard that collects, archives, analyzes
	and displays energy usage at an organization. OED is a Humanitarian
	Free Open Source Software Project (HFOSS) with its roots in the
	educational community. If you have any questions about these projects
	then contact the Organizational Admin (Steven Huss-Lederman,
	<a HREF="mailto:huss@beloit.edu">huss@beloit.edu</a>).
	<h3>Ideas</h3>
	<h4>Graphical Display of Resources</h4>
	<h5>Brief description</h5>
	<p>OED is generalizing to display arbitrary resources.
	<h5>Detailed description</h5>
	<p>
		OED was developed around electrical usage to show its capabilities and
		because that was the most sought after resource. We are transitioning
		to allow for any resource including natural gas, water, chilled water,
		recycling, .... OED will include a module to allow conversion between
		any compatible units (they are all linear transformations) and that
		will be used to graphically display arbitrary resources in the units
		desired. This requires developing the back-end system and modifying
		the graphic displays for this generalization. The initial design of
		this system will be completed this spring. <a
			href="graphicalResources.html">Further details</a> are available.
	<h5>Outcomes</h5>
	<p>When this is complete, OED sites will be able to use, analyze,
		display and download all resources in the same way that it currently
		does electricity.
	<h5>Required/preferred skills</h5>
	<p>A student needs to be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>code JavaScript and be able to learn about JavaScript
			Promises.
		<li>have a working knowledge of React.
		<li>work with SQL to get data from tables and pass the
			information as a object to the graphics package.
		<li>learn to use the Plotly graphics package to display the
			additional resources. This will be a modification of the current
			graphics code. A knowledge of basic graphics packages for line and
			bar graphics is desirable but can be learned.
	</ul>
	<h5>Mentors</h5>
	<p>The primary mentor is Corina Sterbet. The secondary mentor is
		Steven Huss-Lederman.
	<h5>Difficulty</h5>
	<p>This is a medium difficultly project. It involves multiple
		technologies across the OED project but is based on current code that
		can serve as a basis for the changes.
	<h4>Analyze and Display Usage in New Ways</h4>
	<h5>Brief description</h5>
	<p>By including size of buildings, number of people, cost of energy
		and weather data, it is possible to normalize resource usage so
		comparisons are easier across buildings and expected published values.

	
	<h5>Detailed description</h5>
	<p>
		Energy usage in buildings varies by size, number of occupants and the
		weather conditions. To allow sites to better understand how their
		energy usage compares to expectations and across buildings, we will
		allow the data presented to be normalized for these considerations.
		This requires normalizing data based on values in the database (except
		for weather where the data often comes from a weather service and
		hooking this up for some systems is part of this work). GIS
		coordinates are now being added to OED so a stretch goal would be to
		display normalized usage on a map system developed for this project. <a
			href="normalized.html">Further details</a> are available.
	<h5>Outcomes</h5>
	When complete, OED sites will be able to use, analyze, display and
	download normalized data. Sites also want this data for comparison to
	others as well as inclusion in standard reporting systems. Map
	representation would address many requests for this feature.
	<p>
	<h5>Required/preferred skills</h5>
	<p>A student needs to be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>code JavaScript and be able to learn about JavaScript
			Promises.
		<li>Have a working knowledge of React.
		<li>work with SQL to get data from tables, perform SQL arithmetic
			and pass the information as a object to the graphics package. This
			will be a modification of the current code so the level of knowledge
			needed is moderate.
		<li>learn to use the Plotly graphics package to display
			normalized resources. This will be a small modification of the
			current graphics code so a basic understanding is needed. A knowledge
			of basic graphics packages for line and bar graphics is desirable but
			can be learned.
		<li>understand gathering data from a website to acquire weather
			data.
		<li>If the stretch goal of creating maps is addressed, then a
			deeper knowledge of the Plotly graphics package is need. It will also
			require creating a new type of graphic. Only a minimal understanding
			of GIS is needed and could easily be learned during the project.
	</ul>
	<h5>Mentors</h5>
	<p>The primary mentorare James McFeeters and Leonora Tindall. The
		secondary mentor is Steven Huss-Lederman.
	<h5>Difficulty</h5>
	<p>The basic project is easy to medium difficulty. If maps are done
		then it will be on the hard side of medium difficulty.
	<h4>Using Baseline in Displayed Data</h4>
	<h5>Brief description</h5>
	<p>Sites want to subtract the baseline associated with meters or
		building from what is displayed to users.
	<h5>Detailed description</h5>
	<p>A resource baseline is the amount of that resource used when
		nobody is in/using the building and cannot be impacted by the building
		occupants. For occupants and energy managers to better understand
		usage that can be changed, we are adding a feature to allow the
		baseline to be subtracted from a usage graphic. The first goal is to
		do this when the baseline remains the same for all time. A second goal
		is to allow the baseline to vary with time (as happens after
		renovation or equipment change). OED will have a semiautomatic method
		for calculating baselines before the summer begins so they will be
		available in the database.
	<h5>Outcomes</h5>
	<p>OED will better support energy competitions, normalized
		representation of resource data, and have greater utility to energy
		managers.
	<h5>Required/preferred skills</h5>
	<p>A student needs to be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>code JavaScript and be able to learn about JavaScript
			Promises.
		<li>have a working knowledge of React.
		<li>work with SQL to get data from tables, perform SQL arithmetic
			and pass the information as an object to the graphics package. This
			will be a modification of the current code so the level of knowledge
			needed is moderate for the first goal. The second goal will require
			modifying SQL to deal with different time segments of the baseline so
			that will require a reasonably good understanding of SQL and some
			PostgreSQL.
		<li>learn to use the Plotly graphics package to display the
			baselined resource data. This will be a small modification of the
			current graphics code so a basic understanding is needed. A knowledge
			of basic graphics packages for line and bar graphics is desirable but
			can be learned.
	</ul>
	<h5>Mentors</h5>
	<p>The primary mentors are James McFeeters and Corina Sterbet. The
		secondary mentor is Steven Huss-Lederman.
	<h5>Difficulty</h5>
	<p>The first goal is a fairly easy project. The second goal is
		medium difficulty.
	<h4>Admin Access to Expanded Information in OED</h4>
	<h5>Brief description</h5>
	<p>Admins of an OED site need to be able to enter/edit data about
		area, people and cost as well as GIS coordinates.
	<h5>Detailed description</h5>
	<p>As described in other projects, OED is expanding the resources
		it can use and also dealing with GIS data. We are also adding a
		moderate quantity of other data that the admin of an OED site must be
		able to enter and edit. While the current and basic admin panel works,
		we want to improved and expand it. The data associated with meters
		will be able to be entered via boxes or a CSV file so we want to
		change and enhance our CSV interface for the admin panel. A stretch
		goal would allow the admin to edit meter data. Note this project can
		be performed independently of the normalization or other projects.
	<h5>Outcomes</h5>
	<p>When this is complete, an OED site admin will be able to manage
		all information about the system.
	<h5>Required/preferred skills</h5>
	<p>A student needs to be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>code JavaScript and be able to learn about JavaScript
			Promises.
		<li>code using Redux to manage state.
		<li>work with SQL to get and store data from tables. The will be
			at a basic level except for the stretch goal that requires a good
			knowledge of SQL.
		<li>understand and be able to do most HTML formatting and control
			of web pages.
	</ul>
	<h5>Mentors</h5>
	<p>The primary mentor is Leonora Tindall. The secondary mentor is
		Steven Huss-Lederman.
	<h5>Difficulty</h5>
	<p>This task should be a fairly easy project. The stretch goal is
		of medium difficulty.
	<h4>Providing Raw Data to User</h4>
	<h5>Brief description</h5>
	<p>Users have a desire to have the raw and analyzed data in OED
		exported to a CSV file.
	<h5>Detailed description</h5>
	<p>As an open source project, we want the data in OED to be open
		and available. Currently, OED can dump the data from any graph as a
		CSV file but this data has been averaged to reduce the number of
		points. People wishing to analyze the data outside OED generally want
		the underlying meter data (raw data). The quantity of data can be 10s
		or 100s of MB. A complicating factor is that a class of students may
		do downloads all around the same time and thereby overload an OED
		server. Thus, we wish to rate limit the processing and I/O associated
		with doing this.
	<h5>Outcomes</h5>
	<p>People will be able to download raw OED data without impacting
		other server functions.
	<h5>Required/preferred skills</h5>
	<p>A student needs to be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>code JavaScript and be able to learn about JavaScript
			Promises.
		<li>code using Redux to manage state.
		<li>work with SQL to get data from tables. This will be a modest
			modification of existing SQL.
		<li>be able to make basic modification to the React interface for
			the new items displayed to the user.
	</ul>
	<h5>Mentors</h5>
	<p>The primary mentor is Leonora Tindall. The secondary mentor is
		Steven Huss-Lederman.
	<h5>Difficulty</h5>
	<p>This should be an easy project for someone who knows the
		technologies or medium difficulty for someone who will learn some of
		them during the summer.
