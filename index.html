	<h1>Open Energy Dashboard</h1> 
	<p> 
		This project,  also known as OED, is developing a web-based application to display energy
		information that is read and stored from energy meters. While the project involves a lot of technology, it is ultimately about sustainability and supporting those goals. The software is free and, as an open source project, you have access to the code developed and
		used. We welcome people becoming involved in the project or using this
		system on their own sites. If you want to see an example of a live
		system it is available at <a href="http://oed.beloit.edu:3020"
			target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oed.beloit.edu:3020</a>. Please use the links at the top
		of the page to get additional information.

	<p>Note that this system is under active development with regular
		additions of features so the images shown reflect only the current released
		version and not what is coming.</p>
