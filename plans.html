	<h1>Plans for the Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		While OED has been public since March 2017, we have not yet had a
		major public release. To coincide with AASHE 2017, we will be doing
		our first release in mid-October. Please see the <a
			href="features.html">features page</a> to see what that release can
		do.
	</p>
	<p>The OED project already has features we hope to release in 3-6
		months (January-March 2018). These include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
			steam, gas, etc.</li>
		<li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
			system to import meters, enter information needed, and generally
			control the way OED functions at their site.</li>
		<li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
			laundry loads, etc.
		</li>
		<li>Have a virtual energy usage page to allow someone to understand
			the cost associated with using different types of appliances given the
			time per use, how often and how long used, and the number of people
			who use those appliances.</li>
		<li>Make the OED website controls and basic wording
			multilingual.</li>
		<li>Provide email warnings of system issues.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We expect to include other features in the next release. You can
		influence our plans by <a href="involved.html">becoming involved</a>.
	</p>
	<p>We also have a list of <a href="future.html">feature requests</a> that we have yet to decide when to implement.</p>
