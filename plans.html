	<h1>Release Information</h1>
	<p>
		For more information on the features discussed on this page see our <a
			href="features.html">feature page</a>.
	</p>

	<h4>0.3 Release (released 13 February 2018)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Enhance comparison graphic to allow comparing day, week and
			four week periods of time. Improve labeling of graphic based on user
			feedback of initial setup on week periods.</li>
		<li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
			system to enter basic information needed and generally control the
			way OED functions at their site including default behavior for
			non-admins.</li>
		<li>Ability to share charts via a URI (web link). When used, the
			URI reproduces the look/settings from when it was created with the
			most recent data. This is still a live OED view so the user can make
			changes once the initial view is loaded.</li>
		<li>Improved support for mobile devices</li>
		<li>Installs via Docker</li>
		<li>Improved checking of meter data to exclude potentially bad
			data. OED also continues on to other meters after any issues
			encountered.</li>
		<li>Allow admins to import meter data from a CSV file. This will
			allow MAMAC logs, data that existed before meters were read by OED,
			and data from other systems to be imported into OED.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Version 0.2 (released 8 November 2017)</h4>
	<p>Version 0.2 is the first major release of the software and adds
		the ability to acquire, store, and display information about electric
		meter data. Specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added ability to create, edit, and delete groups of meters.</li>
		<li>Added ability to graph one or more meters and/or groups as a
			line or bar graph.</li>
		<li>Added ability to compare one or more meters and/or groups
			energy usage over a one week interval.</li>
		<li>Added ability to link to specific charts.</li>
		<li>Meters and groups now have distinct colors when graphed.</li>
		<li>Improved mobile support.</li>
		<li>Added ability to export readings from system.</li>
		<li>Backend improvements for increased speed, stability, and
			scalability.</li>
		<li>Improved meter import process.</li>
		<li>Other minor improvements and fixes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Known issues of significance</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>The weekly comparison graphs use daily data to calculate
			usage to date. This can lead to large errors when you are later in a
			day and earlier in the week. We are converting to use hour data to
			avoid this issue.</li>
		<li>The calculations used to create the comparison graphs are
			sometimes a little off. This is due to how they are done. This should
			automatically be fixed when the new methods of getting data is
			incorporated in the next release.</li>
		<li>All graphs shown and are labeled as kW. This can be confusing
			since the bar/comparison charts are for a given time period so you
			might expect kWh. This should not change the height of a bar but it
			does change the value. This has been confusing to some users but kWh
			will change as you change the time frame of the bar and make line
			graphs have different units. We have decided that overall it would be
			best to convert to KWh and will make that switch as part of the
			generalization of units planned for an upcoming release.</li>
		<li>A careful user may notice that the values on graphs in OED
			are actually averages of nearby points and not actual meter readings.
			This was done to control the number of points a user receives. We are
			in the process of changing our graphics package so we will allow for
			zooming in on data. This will allow for people to see smaller scale
			data as they zoom. We will also be adding a feature to allow the user
			to dump the actual data from the meters that each graph is showing
			(currently it only allows the averaged data points shown on the
			graph). Finally, we hope to allow the user to see the variance in the
			averaged data on a line graph (such as the max/min value and/or
			25/75% range values) at a future date.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Upcoming</h4>
	<p>
		You can visit our <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/" target="_blank">GitHub
			repository</a> to see issues and find the ongoing status for each issue.
		What follows is a summary of our plans for upcoming releases and, for
		some items, the status of that effort. This was last updated on 14
		December 2017.
	</p>

	<h5>0.5 Release plans with a target release in October 2018
		(significant features that user can observe)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Enhanced admin panel to allow greater control of OED (done)</li>
		<li>Allow for addition of meters via a CSV file in the admin
			panel (done)</li>
		<li>Make the OED web site controls and basic wording multilingual
			(done)</li>
		<li>Provide email warnings of system issues including when meters
			data acquisition fails (done)</li>
		<li>Speed up getting meter data for user (in quality check)</li>
		<li>Ability to read from more meter types including Modbus and
			BACnet. This will be to allow acquisition of Obvius system data. (in
			development/testing)</li>
		<li>Automated database migration tool to allow for easier
			upgrades of sites (done)</li>
		<li>Show when system waiting on data request on graphics pages
			(done)</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>0.6 Release plans with a target release sometime around
		December 2018 (significant features that user can observe)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
			steam, gas, water, garbage/recycling, etc. (in designed)</li>
		<li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
			laundry loads, etc. (in design as part of more energy types)
		</li>
		<li>Add the ability for OED to calculate baseline of a meter on a
			user selected date range indicated on a graph. (in development)</li>
		<li>Allow for user to scroll and zoom on line graphs (in design)</li>
		<li>Allow admin to apply a multiplicative factor to each meter
			added to a group. This will allow for negative values for production
			meters and correction of meter values or units. (awaiting
			development)</li>
		<li>Allow anyone to see what meters and groups are included in a
			group. Currently only admins can do this. (in development)</li>
		<li>Enhance the admin panel including input of new meter
			information from the generalization of meter types. (waiting for
			generalization to move forward)</li>
		<li>Verify a site is responding to web requests in an automated
			way and notify if not working (in development)</li>
		<li>Allow hotlinking to hide menus (similar to a small screen
			device) so it does not show up on a monitor or device without mouse
			(in development)</li>
		<li>Change bar graphics to the KWh (awaiting generalization of
			units)</li>
		<li>Building pages to include descriptions, picture and OED
			graphic with usage including admin tool for inputting this
			information (in design)</li>
		<li>Support HTTPS connects to OED sites we host (in development
			and may be released sooner for those needing it)</li>
		<li>Help system with OED system (in design)</li>
		<li>Make bar charts use hourly data when for shorter time intervals and correct times when values are slightly off (awaiting development)</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>0.7 Release plans with a target release sometime around April
		2019 (significant features that user can observe)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow user to choose if want baseline subtracted from any
			meter/group displayed (might make 0.6 release).</li>
		<li>Allow user to dump raw meter data behind any graph. Currently
			it gives the data points in the graph that represent averaging of the
			data. This will include a warning if the file will be large. We also
			want to rate limit this to avoid slowing down the system for other
			requests. (might make 0.6 release if people make this a priority)</li>
		<li>All graphics will incorporate new resources so they can be
			displayed in OED.</li>
			<li>Include new graphics such as pie charts and radar representations of data.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Actively under development but time frame unknown</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>None to list at this time</li>
	</ul>
