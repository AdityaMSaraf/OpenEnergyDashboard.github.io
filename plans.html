    <h4>Upcoming</h4>
    <p>The system is under active development and we hope to add the following features in the next few months (January-March 2018):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Installs via Docker (done)</li>
    <li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
      steam, gas, etc. (being designed)</li>
    <li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
      system to import meters, enter information needed, and generally
      control the way OED functions at their site. (in development)</li>
    <li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
      laundry loads, etc. (in design as part of more energy types)
    </li>
    <li>Make the OED website controls and basic wording
      multilingual. (in development)</li>
    <li>Provide email warnings of system issues.</li>
    <li>Add the ability for OED to calculate baseline of a meter on a user selectable date range. Groups will automatically
    combine baselines of the meters involved. You will be allowed to have multiple baselines for a given meter
    so it can vary with time. (in development)</li>
  </ul>
