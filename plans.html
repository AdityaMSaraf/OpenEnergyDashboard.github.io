	<h1>Release Information</h1>
	<p>
		For more information on the features discussed on this page see our <a
			href="features.html">feature page</a>.
	</p>

	<h4>0.3 Release (released 13 February 2018)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Enhance comparison graphic to allow comparing day, week and
			four week periods of time. Improve labeling of graphic based on user
			feedback of initial setup on week periods.</li>
		<li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
			system to enter basic information needed and generally control the
			way OED functions at their site including default behavior for
			non-admins.</li>
		<li>Ability to share charts via a URI (web link). When used, the
			URI reproduces the look/settings from when it was created with the
			most recent data. This is still a live OED view so the user can make
			changes once the initial view is loaded.</li>
		<li>Improved support for mobile devices</li>
		<li>Installs via Docker</li>
		<li>Improved checking of meter data to exclude potentially bad
			data. OED also continues on to other meters after any issues
			encountered.</li>
		<li>Allow admins to import meter data from a CSV file. This will
			allow MAMAC logs, data that existed before meters were read by OED,
			and data from other systems to be imported into OED.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Version 0.2 (released 8 November 2017)</h4>
	<p>Version 0.2 is the first major release of the software and adds
		the ability to acquire, store, and display information about electric
		meter data. Specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added ability to create, edit, and delete groups of meters.</li>
		<li>Added ability to graph one or more meters and/or groups as a
			line or bar graph.</li>
		<li>Added ability to compare one or more meters and/or groups
			energy usage over a one week interval.</li>
		<li>Added ability to link to specific charts.</li>
		<li>Meters and groups now have distinct colors when graphed.</li>
		<li>Improved mobile support.</li>
		<li>Added ability to export readings from system.</li>
		<li>Back-end improvements for increased speed, stability, and
			scalability.</li>
		<li>Improved meter import process.</li>
		<li>Other minor improvements and fixes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Known issues of significance</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>The weekly comparison graphs use daily data to calculate
			usage to date. This can lead to large errors when you are later in a
			day and earlier in the week. We are converting to use hour data to
			avoid this issue.</li>
		<li>The calculations used to create the comparison graphs are
			sometimes a little off. This is due to how they are done. This should
			automatically be fixed when the new methods of getting data is
			incorporated in the next release.</li>
		<li>All graphs shown and are labeled as kW. This can be confusing
			since the bar/comparison charts are for a given time period so you
			might expect kWh. This should not change the height of a bar but it
			does change the value. This has been confusing to some users but kWh
			will change as you change the time frame of the bar and make line
			graphs have different units. We have decided that overall it would be
			best to convert to KWh and will make that switch as part of the
			generalization of units planned for an upcoming release.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Upcoming</h4>
	<p>
		You can visit our <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/" target="_blank">GitHub
			repository</a> to see issues and find the ongoing status for each issue.
		What follows is a summary of our plans for upcoming releases and, for
		some items, the status of that effort. This was last updated on 3
		January 2019.
	</p>

	<h5>0.5 Release plans with a target release in January 2019
		(significant features that user can observe or may be interested in)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Ability to read from more meter types including Modbus and
			BACnet. This will be to allow acquisition of Obvius system data.
			(basic system done but working on user interface to easily map Obvius
			meters that want to collect in OED)</li>
		<li>Make the OED web site controls and basic wording multilingual
			(done)</li>
		<li>Support HTTPS connects to OED sites we host (done)</li>
		<li>Allow any user to see what meters and groups constitute a
			group. Currently only admins can do this. It is still the case that
			only admins can edit a group. (done)</li>
		<li>Provide email warnings of system issues including when meters
			data acquisition fails (done)</li>
		<li>Enhanced admin panel to allow greater control of OED (done)</li>
		<li>Allow for addition of MAMAC meters via a CSV file in the
			admin panel (done)</li>
		<li>Show when system waiting on data request on graphics pages
			(done)</li>
		<li>Speed up getting meter data for user (done)</li>
		<li>Automated database migration tool to allow for easier
			upgrades of sites (done)</li>
		<li>In the past, OED was worked with pulse meters that only
			returned integral values. This upgrade allows OED to store floating
			point data so it can correctly acquire from all meter types. (done)</li>
		<li>Allow hotlinking to hide menus (similar to a small screen
			device) so it does not show up on a monitor or device without mouse
			(done)</li>
		<li>Updated all software packages used to address any known
			security issues. (done) This will be an ongoing effort.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>1.0 Release plans with a target release in second half of 2019
		(significant features that user can observe or may be interested in
		where the exact features of this release are still in flux)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Change and upgrade graphics package to support greater
			functionality. We are discontinuing use of chart.js and switching to
			Plotly. This should allow for easy addition of new graphic
			representations (pie charts, radar graphs) that have been requested.
			It will also support maps and make semi-automatic baselining easier
			for the user. Some of these new graphical representations many be
			part of this release. (in development with rough versions of line and
			compare charts done)
		<li>Add the ability for OED to calculate baseline of a meter on a
			user selected date range indicated on a graph. (database side done,
			user interface in development)</li>
		<li>Allow for user to scroll and zoom on line graphs (in
			development with rough version done)</li>
		<li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
			steam, gas, water, garbage/recycling, etc. (in designed)</li>
		<li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
			laundry loads, etc. (in design as part of more energy types)
		</li>
		<li>Change bar graphics to the KWh (awaiting generalization of
			units)</li>
		<li>Enhance the admin panel including input of new meter
			information from the generalization of meter types. (waiting for
			generalization to move forward)</li>
		<li>Verify a site is responding to web requests in an automated
			way and notify if not working (in development)</li>
		<li>Links to allow sites to have building pages. We may add
			standard building pages in the furture if there is sufficient demand.
			(in design)</li>

		<li>Help system with OED system (in design)</li>
		<li>Make bar charts use hourly data when for shorter time
			intervals and correct times when values are slightly off (in
			development)</li>
		<li>Have OED created backups of the database data to allow for
			easier restoration if something goes wrong (design done)</li>
		<li>Don't allow negative meter readings to be recorded and warn
			admin if a reading on a given meter exceeds that meter's threshold
			value. This will address two concerns/requests. First, sites have
			experienced meter values that seem wrong (provided by the meter).
			Second, admins would be warned of high usage that may indicate a
			problem (such as a water leak). (in design)
		<li>Some sites do not have a viable/cheap way to read their meter
			data in real-time. Some of these sites can get an automated data
			export of the meter data at specified time intervals (such as each
			day). This meter data is often in CSV format or can be converted to
			CSV format. We are going to generalize our CSV import of meter data
			so it can be accepted via a software request (with username and
			password), allow for different ordering of the data by date, allow
			for specifying the interval of time for each meter point, and allow
			for meter data where is point is the actual meter reading or a
			cumulative value. We have a site that is producing software to feed
			such a CSV file to OED and will contirubte it for others to use.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>1.1 Release plans where these are important features that we
		plan to implement after 1.0 release (significant features that user
		can observe)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow user to choose if want baseline subtracted from any
			meter/group displayed.</li>
		<li>Allow user to dump raw meter data behind any graph. Currently
			it gives the data points in the graph that represent averaging of the
			data. This will include a warning if the file will be large. We also
			want to rate limit this to avoid slowing down the system for other
			requests. Note that sites can now manually export meter data if they
			have superuser access to the server on which OED is running where we
			can provide directions on how to do this. We will also help sites
			with full dumps until this feature is part of OED.</li>
		<li>All graphics will incorporate new resources so they can be
			displayed in OED.</li>
		<li>Include new graphics such as pie charts and radar
			representations of data (might be in 1.0)</li>
		<li>Allow admin to apply a multiplicative factor to each meter
			added to a group. This will allow for negative values for production
			meters and correction of meter values or units. (awaiting
			development)</li>
		<li>To speed up OED presenting graphical data and to limit the
			data transferred (esp. useful on mobile devices), OED does data
			averaging on the server so it only returns the number of points the
			user can realistically display on their device. The planned zoom
			feature in release 1.0 will help users who want to see more detailed
			data because the shorter the time frame, the less time is represented
			by each averaged point on the graphic. We have received requests to
			show the actual meter data but we don't view that as a viable option
			given the large number of points that OED can store on each meter.
			One option is to dump the meter data and graph it outside OED (but
			you still have limits on time to prodice the graphic and number of
			points you can see at any time). The planned OED solution is to have
			a graphic that shows the averaged points (as OED currently does) but
			also display the range of values that are represented by the averaged
			point. One simply way to do this is to show the maximum and minimum
			value above and below the averaged point (as in a type of error bar).
			If these two additional value differ significantly from the average
			then you know the averaging has glossed over details that might be of
			interest. You can then zoom into this region to see more details. We
			are also looking into fancier techniques and automated ways to show
			details in regions with greater variation in data values but will
			first produce a simpler version as a demonstration.</li>
		<li>Normalize data based on sq. ft, number of people.</li>
		<li>Normalize data by cost where a fixed cost per unit of energy
			is used. This should be easy once we have the normalization of data
			but will require an admin feature to specify cost.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Actively under development but time frame unknown</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow for line graphs that compare one time frame to another.
			For example, compare the current year to the previous year. This is
			different than the comparison bar graphs that show the total usage in
			that range. Here you would see the points of usage across the time
			desired.</li>
	</ul>
