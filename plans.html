	</p>


	<h4>Version 0.2</h4>
	<p>Version 0.2 is the first major release of the software and adds
		the ability to acquire, store, and display information about electric
		meter data. Specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added ability to create, edit, and delete groups of meters.</li>
		<li>Added ability to graph one or more meters and/or groups as a
			line or bar graph.</li>
		<li>Added ability to compare one or more meters and/or groups
			energy usage over a one week interval.</li>
		<li>Added ability to link to specific charts.</li>
		<li>Meters and groups now have distinct colors when graphed.</li>
		<li>Improved mobile support.</li>
		<li>Added ability to export readings from system.</li>
		<li>Backend improvements for increased speed, stability, and
			scalability.</li>
		<li>Improved meter import process.</li>
		<li>Other minor improvements and fixes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Known issues of significance</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>The weekly comparison graphs use daily data to calculate
			usage to date. This can lead to large errors when you are later in a
			day and earlier in the week. We are converting to use hour data to
			avoid this issue.</li>
		<li>All graphs show and are labeled as kW. This can be confusing
			since the bar/comparison charts are for a given time period so you
			might expect kWh. This should not change the height of a bar but it
			does change the value. This has been confusing to some users but kWh
			will change as you change the time frame of the bar and make line
			graphs have different units. Thus, we are trying to determine what is
			best to do and how to label graphs. We welcome input from others and
			plan to have this settled by version 0.4 when we introduce more unit
			types in OED.</li>
		<li>A careful user may notice that the values on graphs in OED
			are actually averages of nearby points and not actual meter readings.
			This was done to control the number of points a user receives without
			undue effort during initial development. We are currently converting
			OED to use actual meter points where we select the spacing based on
			the time frame to show and the number of points to send to the user.
			We believe this is better but is more complex for the system so hang
			in there until it is complete. It is hoped to make version 0.3 and is
			certain for version 0.4.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Upcoming</h4>
	<p>
		You can visit our <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/" target="_blank">GitHub
			repository</a> to see issues and find the ongoing status for each issue.
		What follows is a summary of our plans for upcoming releases and, for
		some items, the status of that effort. This was last updated on 14
		December 2017.
	</p>
	<h5>0.3 Release plans with a release planned for early February
		2018</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Installs via Docker (done)</li>
		<li>Improved checking of meter data to exclude potentially bad
			data. OED also continues on to other meters after any issues
			encountered. (done)</li>
		<li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
			system to enter basic information needed and generally control the
			way OED functions at their site. (done)</li>
		<li>Enhance comparison graphic to allow comparing day, week and
			four week periods of time. Improve labeling of graphic based on user
			feedback of initial setup on week periods. (done)</li>
		<li>Allow admins to import meter data from a CSV file. This will
			allow MAMAC logs, data that existed before meters were read by OED,
			and data from other systems to be imported into OED. (done)</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>0.4 Release plans with a target release sometime around early
		March 2018</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Enhanced admin panel to allow greater control of OED</li>
		<li>Allow for addition of meters via a CSV file in the admin
			panel (in development)</li>
		<li>Make the OED website controls and basic wording multilingual.
			(well into development)</li>
		<li>Enhance comparison graphs to allow arbitrary time width and
			arbitrary shift in time between current and previous.</li>
		<li>Provide email warnings of system issues (in development and
			nearing testing)</li>
		<li>Speed up getting meter data for users. This will also allow
			users to download the raw meter data from a graph rather than just
			the points shown on the graph.</li>
		<li>Ability to read from more meter types including Modbus and
			BACnet. This is planned through third party hardware at this
			time but we welcome anyone interested in creating another solution to
			contact us.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>0.5 Release plans with a target release sometime around April
		2018</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
			steam, gas, water, garbage/recycling, etc. (being designed)</li>
		<li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
			laundry loads, etc. (in design as part of more energy types)
		</li>
		<li>Add the ability for OED to calculate baseline of a meter on a
			user selectable date range. Groups will automatically combine
			baselines of the meters involved. You will be allowed to have
			multiple baselines for a given meter so it can vary with time. All
			graphics will take baselines into account. (in development)</li>
		<li>Allow admin to apply a multiplicitive factor to each meter
			added to a group. This will allow for negative values for production
			meters and correction of meter values or units.</li>
		<li>Allow anyone to see what meters and groups are included in a
			group. Currently only admins can do this.</li>
		<li>Enhance the admin panel including input of new meter
			information from the generalization of meter types.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Actively under development but time frame unknown</h5>
	<ul>
<li>None to list at this time</li>
	</ul>
