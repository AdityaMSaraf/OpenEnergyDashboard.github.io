	</p>


	<h4>Version 0.2</h4>

		the ability to acquire, store, and display information about electric
		meter data. Specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added ability to create, edit, and delete groups of meters.</li>
		<li>Added ability to graph one or more meters and/or groups as a
			line or bar graph.</li>
		<li>Added ability to compare one or more meters and/or groups
			energy usage over a one week interval.</li>
		<li>Added ability to link to specific charts.</li>
		<li>Meters and groups now have distinct colors when graphed.</li>
		<li>Improved mobile support.</li>
		<li>Added ability to export readings from system.</li>
		<li>Backend improvements for increased speed, stability, and
			scalability.</li>
		<li>Improved meter import process.</li>
		<li>Other minor improvements and fixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Upcoming</h4>
	<p>
		You can visit our <a
			href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/" target="_blank">GitHub
			repository</a> to see issues and find the ongoing status for each issue.
		What follows is a summary of our plans for upcoming releases and, for
		some items, the status of that effort. This was last updated on 8 December 2017.
	</p>
	<h5>0.3 Release plans with a release planned for end of January
		2018</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Installs via Docker (done)</li>
		<li>Improved checking of meter data to exclude potentially bad data. OED also continues on to other meters after any issues 
		encountered. (done)</li>
		<li>An admin panel to allow someone responsible for the OED
			system to enter information needed and generally
			control the way OED functions at their site. (in development and
			nearing testing)</li>
		<li>Make the OED website controls and basic wording multilingual.
			(going into testing)</li>
			<li>Enhance comparison graphic to allow comparing day, week and four week periods of time. 
			Improve labeling of graphic based on user feedback of initial setup on week periods. (in development)</li>
			<li>Allow admins to import meter data from a CSV file. This will allow MAMAC logs, data that existed before meters
			were read by OED, and data from other systems to be imported into OED. (in testing)</li>
		<li>Provide email warnings of system issues (in development and nearing testing)</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>0.4 Release plans with a target release sometime around March
		2018</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Generalization of energy types beyond electricity including
			steam, gas, water, garbage/recycling, etc. (being designed)</li>
		<li>Allow energy to be represented in other units such as CO<sub>2</sub>,
			laundry loads, etc. (in design as part of more energy types)
		</li>
		<li>Add the ability for OED to calculate baseline of a meter on a
			user selectable date range. Groups will automatically combine
			baselines of the meters involved. You will be allowed to have
			multiple baselines for a given meter so it can vary with time. All
			graphics will take baselines into account. (in development)</li>
			<li>Allow admin to apply a multiplicitive factor to each meter added to a group.
			This will allow for negative values for production meters and correction of meter values or units.</li>
			<li>Allow anyone to see what meters and groups are included in a group. Currently only admins can do this.</li>
			<li>Enhance the admin panel including allowing for addition of meters via a CSV file and input of new meter information from
			the generalization of meter types</li>
			<li>Speed up getting meter data for users. This will also allow users to download the raw meter data from a graph rather than 
			just the points shown on the graph.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Actively under development but time frame unknown</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Ability to read from more meter types including Modbus and BACnet. This is likely to be through third party hardware at this
		time but we welcome anyone interested in creating another solution to contact us.</li>
		</ul>
