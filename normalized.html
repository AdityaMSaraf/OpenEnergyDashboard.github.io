	<h3>OED feature enhancement: analyze and display usage in new ways</h3>
	<h4>Idea</h4>
	<p>OED currently displays resources as the actual usage or an
		aggregation of actual usage from arbitrary combination of meters that
		can represent a building. It is well known that usage in a building is
		related to the area of the building, number of occupants and the
		weather. A common technique is it to normalize the resource usage based
		upon these considerations. The plan is to modify OED to allow for
		input/collection of this information and to modify the graphics for
		the normalized data.
	<p>The stretch goal would be to use the new GIS coordinates to
		create a map representation of the normalized data. A circle would be
		centered at the GIS coordinate of each building. The size/color of the
		circle would indicate the normalized usage.
	<h4>Implementation</h4>
	<p>
		The database needs to be modified to allow for storage of these values
		and an API created to work with these values. Except for weather, the
		admin panel needs to be modified to allow entry of the values for each
		meter and grouping of meters. This may be done in conjunction with
		another GSoC project that is extending the <a href="admin.html">admin
			panel</a>. The API for data needs to be modified to normalize the data
		based on the chosen value. The graphical pages need to have an option
		added to allow the user to choose to display the desired
		normalization. Note another GSoC project is doing <a
			href="graphicalResources.html">unit conversion</a> and this has
		similarities to these steps.
	<p>Doing weather is fundamentally different for three reasons.
		First, the data varies with time so the data API change is not a
		simple subtraction across all data values. Second, the primary
		consideration is temperature but weather can also include the amount
		of sun and wind. This is an area where investigation needs to be made
		to determine how best to include these effects. Third, the data does
		not come from the admin  panel but is received from an outside source. This
		means that doing weather will be a separate step from area and number
		of occupants.
	<p>We have already tested getting limited data from the U.S.
		National Weather Service and it was successful. This needs to be made
		robust and acquired on a regular basis including allowing the admin to
		specify the GIS coordinates for deciding what weather data to ask for.
		It would be desirable to get the weather data from at least one other major
		source to make sure the methods are general and to allow sites from
		other geographical areas to use this feature. This should make it much
		easier to add other geographical areas in the future.
	<p>Adding a normalized map representation will use the Plotly
		graphics package that has features to do this type of representation.
		Since the geographical area of an organization is considered limited,
		an image of the map will be loaded in OED where the GIS coordinates of
		the top left and lower right corners of the image are input. The
		placement of circles by GIS coordinates of buildings will be based on
		a linear scale across the image.
	<p>
	<h4>Difficulty</h4>
	<p>This enhancement includes changes to both the front-end and
		back-end of OED by touching database queries, the data API and the
		Plotly graphical package and involves a number of technologies. What
		will make it somewhat easier is the new code will be based on existing
		code except for the map representation. As such, it is likely to be a
		medium difficult project where maps will make it a harder medium
		difficult project.
