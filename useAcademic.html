	<h1>Academic Use Examples of the Open Energy Dashboard</h1>
	<p>
		The OED system has a number of features. This page describes many of them in the context of how they might be
		used at an academic institution along with links to further documentation. The <a href="features.html">features
			page</a> overviews OED's capabilities in terms of each feature rather than uses and shows a number of
		features not touched on this page. Some people may wish to see
		a number of these features by using
		our <a href="demo.html">live demo site</a>. Also note that there are many options for graphics and this page
		often gives one example. The "Further information" links to the OED help web pages provide all the options.</p>
	<p>The uses and primary features they demonstrate that will be discussed are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#varietyAudiences">Displaying data for a variety of audiences</a>: features the line, bar and map
			graphic</li>
		<li><a href="#buildings">Buildings and campus level data display</a>: features the group capability</li>
		<li><a href="#competition">Energy Competitions</a>: features comparison graphic</li>
		<li><a href="#webpages">Including OED in webpages for campus</a>: features chart links</li>
		<li><a href="#internal">Internal usage by facilities, sustainability coordinator</a>: features zoom in on data,
			hide meters</li>
		<li><a href="#courses">Usage for research/courses</a>: features export data after graph, export user role</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="varietyAudiences">Displaying data for a variety of audiences</h2>
	<p>Different people want to see energy usage in different ways. A classic use of an energy dashboard is to show
		graphics of usage such as</p>
	<ul>
		<li>See how usage varies with time as a line graph</li>
		<li>See how usage varies when grouped by days, weeks, etc. in a bar graph</li>
		<li>See usage on a map to give a spacial overview</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will now look at each of these. Note that OED uses the term meter to apply to a data collection item since it
		is often a physical meter on a campus. In what follows, there are four meters with one year of data for
		electrical usage with the
		following meaning:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dorm A Residents: represents the usage in Dorm A that is attributed to residents.</li>
		<li>Dorm A Other: represents the usage in Dorm A that is not attributed to residents. In this scenario, there
			are
			two meters in this dorm so the sum of the two is the total usage in the dorm.</li>
		<li>Dorm B Residents: same as Dorm A Residents but for another dorm named Dorm B.</li>
		<li>Dorm B Other: same as Dorm A Other but for another dorm named Dorm B.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following graphic shows the usage for each of the four meters as a line graph of usage vs. time:</p>
	<img alt="line graphic with four meters" src="images/OEDAcademicLine.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The following graphic shows the same usage but as a bar graphic where each bar represents four weeks of usage:
	</p>
	<img alt="bar graphic with four meters" src="images/OEDAcademicBar.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The following graphic shows the residents usage in Dorms A & B as a map where the circle size indicates relative
		usage. All four meters could have been shown but since each pair
		is for the same building it is harder to see the individual circles for one building. In this case it shows
		average usage for one week where the hover shows the exact value for Dorm B.

	<h2 id="buildings">Buildings and campus level data display</h2>
	<p>An academic institution often wants to show usage for different areas on campus. For example, you might want to
		show the
		total usage for all residential buildings. OED can aggregate (sum) any combination of meters via its group
		feature. In this example, we will show the total electrical usage for each Dorm and for both dorms together.
		Graphically this means doing:
	</p>
	<img alt="dorms as groups" src="images/academicGroupings.png" style="width: 50vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The image shows that "Dorm A Residents" and "Dorm A Other" meters are grouped to form "Dorm A". When you graph
		"Dorm A"
		you will get the sum of the two underlying meters. The image shows a similar "Dorm B" group. It also shows that
		you can group "Dorm A" and "Dorm B" to create the "All Residential" group. This shows the groups in OED are very
		general and can be composed of any combination of meters and groups. This can greatly simplify grouping items as
		they can be built from previous groups. The following shows a map that is very
		similar to the one for meters but now showing the total usage for "Dorm A" and "Dorm B" as groups. The line or
		bar graphic can also show groups.</p>

	<h2 id="competition">Energy Competitions</h2>
	<p>To engage students, some academic institutions use energy competitions. In a common usage, each dorm completes to
		see which ones can reduce their usage the most. The comparison graphic in OED supports this type of competition.
		In the following figure, the usage from last week vs. this week is displayed for each dorm (group) where the
		title gives the percentage change (green for less and red for more). The graphs are sorted so the dorm with the
		greatest decrease is first but you can choose to do the least first or alphabetically. You can include as many
		items as you wish on one comparison page (only two shown here).</p>

		style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

	<h2 id="webpages">Including OED in webpages for campus</h2>
	<p>It is common for an academic institution to want to graphically show energy usage on a website. Someone can
		create any graphic view they wish and then click the "Toggle chart link" button to reveal a web address (URL).
		That web address can be reused anywhere (web page, email link, etc.) and it will recreate the OED graphic
		that was shown when it was created. One feature is that the link recreates the same look but with current data.
		What this means is that if you had a link to a compare graphic to show usage for the last week that was created
		at the start of January, if some used it in the middle of February they would see the same comparisons (such as
		the two dorms in the example above) but for the current week in February.</p>

	<h2 id="internal">Internal usage by facilities, sustainability coordinator</h2>
	<p>For many reasons, OED normally shows daily points when a line graph is first shown. Seeing this level of detail
		on energy usage is often sufficient for most users. Some users, such as energy managers and sustainability
		coordinators, may wish to see usage on shorter time scales to investigate interesting usage patterns. OED allows
		users to zoom in on time frames and scroll across times. You can also have OED redraw a graphic to get shorter
		time frames for each point. OED can display data as daily, hourly or the original raw meter data. This allows
		the user to see the data at appropriate time scales depending on need. The figure below shows hourly data in an
		area where the usage was higher than normal. One can see that starting about July 23, the usage has the highest
		spikes. This graphic has both the overall usage for Dorm A and the two meters that monitor its usage.
		The graphic clearly shows that it is Dorm A Other that is varying and causing the spikes and the Dorm A
		Residents are using more normal amount of electricity (but it is slowly going up). If you look at the line
		graphic above, you will see the spike in usage around this time but you cannot see the ones around it nor the
		fluctuations that are occurring. This new graphic with more frequent readings allows this level of detail to be
		shown. This figure also shows that you can get a hover at any point to see the usage at that time for any line
		in the graphic. Also note that the bar and map graphic will honor the time frame chosen on the line graphic so
		in this case would limit readings shown to July 17 to July 29.</p>

	<h2 id="courses">Usage for research/courses</h2>
	<p>When students are investigating energy usage, they often need to work interactively with the data. OED is
		somewhat unique in that it allows users to interactively choose what information to display including the
		meters, groups, time frame and frequency of points. OED uses a sophisticated program so that any user choice is
		normally displayed within one second. This allows users to look at the data in various ways to understand what
		is going on. As discussed above, this includes focusing on specific dates/times that are of interest. OED
		recognizes that there are times you want to have the energy data (readings) to analyze them outside OED. This
		could be to do a type of analysis OED does not support. To allow this, OED has two export features for line or
		bar graphics. The "Export graph data" gives you the energy data shown on the current graph. Thus, if you are
		showing the data with daily points then you will get one point for each day for each meter or group. The "Export
		raw graph data" exports at the resolution of the original meter data. For example, if the meter displayed
		collected readings every 15 minutes then you would get a point every 15 minutes. In either case, the export
		provides a CSV (comma separated values) spreadsheet file with the reading data. Given that OED can rapidly
		display any graphic, the user can use the capability to get the exact data they want before exporting. This
		reduces the size of files downloaded and allows users to take advantage of OED's capabilities to get grouped
		data, limited time frames, bar data, etc. This feature can also be useful to facilities and sustainability
		coordinators.</p>
	<p>Obviously, the raw data normally
		creates a much larger file since it has more readings. To stop inadvertent downloads of large files, OED will
		warn
		the user if the file is larger than a site specified size. If the file is larger than another site specified
		size, then only users logged can download that data. OED allows sites to create as many users of this type as
		they want so a site can create a unique one for each person, class or other group. They can also be removed so
		access times can be limited.</p>
